        <h1>Motion for a Resolution by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>The kids are (not) alright:</b> While young Europeans are politically engaging for ends like Fridays for Future or Black Lives Matter, the minimum age to 
        vote - a basic aspect of political participation - remains 18 in almost all Member States. Considering that the European Parliament already recommended 
        lowering the voting age in 2015, how can the EU finally enhance these rights for young people?</em>
        </p>

        <p class="names"><br>Submitted by: Izzy Bruce (Royal and Prior Comprehensive school Raphoe, IE),  Bridget Reidy Dundan (Portlaoise College Laois, IE),

        <p><br><b>The European Youth Parliament aims to lower the voting age to 16 at regional, national, and European elections. We recognise that the youth is 
            politically mature enough to make informed decisions, and we aim to provide a cohesive, comprehensive, and innovative curriculum to further educate 
            them. We truly believe that an education on political issues is key to the youth effectively utilising their vote. Our committee recognises that voting 
            young is essential to habitual voting which will enhance our European democracy.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Because</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The youth has demonstrated political interest and maturity through participating in political advocacy and campaigns,</li>
            <li>Young workers under the age of 18 are obligated to civic duties, such as paying taxes, while remaining unable to vote,</li>
            <li>Despite the record turnout of young voters in the 2019 European elections, voting turnout remains the highest among over-60-year-olds,</li>
            <li>Many young people feel unheard and believe they are not represented effectively by their government,</li>
            <li>The misconception that all young people lack the political knowledge and maturity to make informed political decisions causes young people to be denied suffrage,</li>
            <li>The lack of standardised, quality, and unbiased civic education across Europe leads to a lack of political participation and political awareness in some young people,</li>
            <li>There is a lack of willingness amongst politicians to advocate for teen suffrage in fear of alienating current voters;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The European Youth Parliament, to achieve these aims,</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Urges all Member States to follow the European Parliament’s 2015 recommendation to harmonise the voting age at 16 in regional, national, and European elections;</li>
            <li>Requests Member States to expand work experience opportunities in governmental institutions, making them accessible to all young people;</li>
            <li>Asks the European Commission to use the Erasmus+ programme to support Member States in integrating an interactive, non-partisan curriculum covering European politics into primary and secondary education;</li>
            <li>Recommends the European Parliament to create a section on their website, in consultation with the youth, which updates the youth and the general population on EU political parties and their youth wings;</li>
            <li>Expresses its appreciation of the citizen engagement achieved by the Conference on the Future of Europe and invites the European Commission to:
                <ul>
                    <li>make it a regularly recurring project,</li>
                    <li>increase its accessibility by lowering the participation age to 14;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Invites the European Parliament to actively reach out to young people, encouraging them to stand for election;</li>
            <li>Suggests the European Parliament relaunch the ‘This Time I’m Voting’ campaign to impress on the youth the importance of their vote and encourage them to use their voice;</li>
            <li>Proposes that Member States launch outreach campaigns through social media to encourage young people to be active in their local political environment;</li>
            <li>Encourages the European Commission to target grants towards countries with less politically active youth to instigate greater political knowledge and active citizenship in their young people;</li>
            <li>Calls upon the European Commission to provide increased funding to the ‘European Parliament Ambassador School Programme’ in order to further connect young people across Europe with their  politicians.</li>
