        <h1>Motion for a Resolution by the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>Edu technology: </b>A significant disruption in the educational systems, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, expedited the 
            transition to remote learning and drew attention to the role of digital technologies in education. With artificial intelligence (AI) currently high on 
            the political and research agenda, how can the EU rationally prepare its Member States' educational systems for such technological development, 
            balancing both the threats and opportunities surrounding AI?</em>
        </p>

        <p class="names"><br>Submitted by: Anastazja Malon (Scoil Mhuire Buncrana, IE), Aisling McQuillan (Dundalk Grammar School, IE), Aron Mcmanus (St. Joseph's 
            Drogheda, IE), Avery Mitchell (Royal and Prior Comprehensive School, IE), Giulia Vitali (IT),  Katie Reenan (Dundalk Grammar School, IE), Maitiú Doyle 
            (St. Joseph’s Rush, IE), Neil Gallogly (Catholic University School, IE), Sean Corcoran (Colaiste Choilm, IE), Siún Donnely (Mountrath Community School, 
            IE), Teniver Birkhaeuser (CH), Faduma Mohammed (Cork Educate Together Secondary School, IE), Séamus Ryan (IE, Chairperson)
        </p>

        <p><br><b>The European Youth Parliament aims to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the education systems of Member States with the purpose of 
            making it accessible to all while improving teaching, fairness, and efficiency. Furthermore, we aim to introduce regulations on AI in the education 
            sector to limit its threats. As a result, we hope to allow these systems to grow and evolve, preparing for the future of education while promoting 
            innovation and limiting threats along the way.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Because</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>There is a lack of knowledge among teachers in relation to the application of AI as a teaching aid,</li>
            <li>Due to increasing class sizes, teachers need more assistance with menial tasks such as the correction of tests in order to improve their focus and quality of teaching,</li>
            <li>Many traditional education systems throughout the EU do not sufficiently support students with learning disabilities,</li>
            <li>AI was shown to greatly help in facilitating an easier implementation of new learning methods, thus helping students with different learning styles,</li>
            <li>It has been proven that AI reduces human error and bias within education systems, though on the long-term can suffer from concept drift;</li>
            <li>The lack of IT departments in some Member States’ educational institutions imposes an obstacle to the deployment of AI in schools,</li>
            <li>There is a lack of regulation to ensure children’s safety surrounding AI usage;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The European Youth Parliament, to achieve these aims,</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Suggests the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council (EYCS) to establish subdivisions in their departments which implement training schemes educating teaching staff on the use of AI programs;</li>
            <li>Urges Member States to ensure  AI implementation strictly occur in an assistive role in education;</li>
            <li>Encourages the DG EAC to develop AI solutions dedicated to supporting teachers in managing their classes;</li>
            <li>Directs the European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education to develop intelligent virtual assistants, specifically for recognising and assisting students with learning disabilities;</li>
            <li>Requests the Directorate-General on Education, Youth, Sport and Culture (DG EAC) to include the supply of AI-powered personalised, student-tailored education in the European Education Area initiative (EHEA);</li>
            <li>Recommends Member States to create national agencies that monitor AI-developing companies and ensure that the effectiveness of AI solutions is maintained;</li>
            <li>Instructs the DG EAC to subsidise the modernisation of schools’ IT equipment, such as laptops and tablets, preparing for possible AI deployment;</li>
            <li>Invites the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) to fund the development of an AI-centred educational framework.</li>
