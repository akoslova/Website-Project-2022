        <h1>Motion for a Resolution by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>What goes around, comes around:</b> The European Commission adopted the new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) in 2020 
            as a part of the European Green Deal. Bearing in mind that the transition towards a circular economy is necessary for the EU to reach its 2050 climate 
            neutrality target, how can the EU move forward from
            a linear model of production and consumption toward a more sustainable future?</em>
        </p>

        <p class="names"><br>Submitted by: Niamh Bugler (Scoil Mhuire Cork, IE), David Canning (Villiers School, IE), Caitríona Cogan (Gaelcholáiste Charraig Uí 
            Leighin, IE), Aisling Cotter (Killina Presentation Secondary School, IE), Neel Gupta (Christian Brothers College, IE), Laura Marmion (Maryfield

        </p>

        <p><br><b>The European Youth Parliament aims to adopt a circular economy in Europe in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and waste while increasing 
            economic and environmental sustainability. Consumers and businesses have to understand the workings and potential of the circular economy for people, 
            planet and profit. Policies are needed to incentivise circular production and consumption, and decentivise linear practices.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Because</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Climate education focuses on overwhelmingly negative problems rather than positive solutions,</li>
            <li>The circular economy sustains product and material value that would otherwise be lost in emissions and waste in the linear economy, thereby polluting the environment,</li>
            <li>Low costs and planned obsolescence tempt consumers to dispose of and replace products, rather than repair them,</li>
            <li>Consumers have limited knowledge of the benefits of a circular economy, making them both sceptical towards circular consumption and reluctant to change from the unsustainable options that they are used to,</li>
            <li>Industries, markets and consumers lack official standardised metrics to assess and compare the degree of circularity of products and services,</li>
            <li>Traditional business education focuses on a linear model of production, resulting in incompetence to operate in the circular economy,</li>
            <li>Businesses are reluctant to change a profitable linear business model and unsure if investing new capital in a circular model is justified,</li>
            <li>Start-up businesses with a circular model struggle to compete with conventional linear businesses on price, image and market position;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The European Youth Parliament, to achieve these aims,</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Requests Member States raise public awareness of the potential of the circular economy, by:
                <ul>
                    <li>integrating the topic of the circular economy into primary, secondary and tertiary level education, with a focus on positive solutions to the climate crisis,</li>
                    <li>launching media campaigns through means such as TV and social media;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Invites second and third level educational institutions to integrate more content on the circular economy in business and economic courses,</li>
            <li>Encourages EuroCommerce to support retailers to offer circularly and sustainably produced options to consumers, and to form close relations with firms operating within the circular economy, in order to be considered as leaders in sustainable commerce;</li>
            <li>Directs the Directorate General for Environment (DG ENV) to implement legislation to increase the use of reusable packaging where single-use is most common,</li>
            <li>Recommends Member States invest in increased infrastructure enabling circular economy such as recycling facilities and composters, to better process waste from businesses and consumers,</li>
            <li>Calls upon DG ENV, in conjunction with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), to create a standardised grade system to measure a product's sustainability by evaluating how its production, distribution, consumption and disposal impact the environment,</li>
            <li>Asks the European Investment Bank (EIB) to financially assist businesses transitioning to or creating a circular economic model, through grants and funding like the European Fund for Strategic Investments,</li>
            <li>Urges Member States to award tax benefits to start-ups and local businesses applying a circular model, allowing them to maintain low prices and to remain competitive in the market,</li>
            <li>Strongly encourages Member States to introduce legislation extending the lifecycle of products, by incentivising companies to:
                <ul>
                    <li>improve the durability and longevity of their products,</li>
                    <li>offer accessible and affordable repair services,</li>
                    <li>where possible, use components that are easily recyclable,</li>
                    <li>where possible, use components that do not contain materials which present a significant environmental hazard when disposed of,</li>
                    <li>make readily available all necessary information on the correct way to dispose of their products;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Proposes the UNEP to provide advice and resources for companies to adopt ‘Product-as-a-Service’ and rental products into their business model, through means like information workshops and advisory committees.</li>
        </ol>
