        <h1>Motion for a Resolution by the Committee on Emplyment and Social Affairs II (EMPL II)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>Can you pay my bills?</b> Based on the 2020 Resolution of the European Parliament, a long-standing discussion about 
            unpaid internships seems to still be asking questions about whether they are a necessary bridge between education and employment or an opportunity 
            for businesses to take advantage of free labour. Should the European governments take further steps and act to protect the working conditions of 
            stagiaires and interns across the continent?</em>
        </p>

        <p class="names"><br>Submitted by: Abby Bradfield (Coláiste Na Toirbhirte, IE), Emily Cormican (Banagher College, IE), Edita Dimitrova Delcheva (BG), 
            Conor Lynch (Catholic University School, IE), Katie McShane (Loreto Secondary School, IE), Dearbhaile Ní Dhúill (Coláiste Íosagáin, IE), James O’Brien

        </p>

        <p><br><b>The European Youth Parliament aims to improve working conditions for interns going forward in an economically practical manner to meet their 
            needs while gaining valuable experience during their internship. Furthermore, we aim to give people from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds 
            better access to internships. We wish to improve education and awareness around the rights of interns in the workplace. </b>
        </p>

        <h2>Because</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Legal definitions of internships vary between Member States, with some having no such definition,</li>
            <li>Existing schemes that help young people find internships are currently ineffective, </li>
            <li>An estimated 61% of interns in the EU received no financial compensation for their work,</li>
            <li>Access to internships can depend on financial status, with 54% of interns receiving insufficient compensation to cover their day-to-day expenses and 65% of interns relying on financial support from their parents,</li>
            <li>Internships can form a mandatory part of the interns’ studies, requiring interns to put themselves in a financially vulnerable position in order to graduate,</li>
            <li>Quality standards and conditions for internships highly vary within and between Member States,</li>
            <li>Internships are often a form of unpaid labour instead of being the productive training opportunities they are marketed as;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The European Youth Parliament, to achieve these aims,</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Suggests the Ministers of Social Affairs of Member States come to an agreement on a standardised EU-wide legal definition of an intern and internship;</li>
            <li>Instructs the Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture (DG EAC) to expand schemes that benefit young people searching for suitable internships, such as the Youth Guarantee;</li>
            <li>Encourages Member States to establish a set, liveable wage for interns based on the cost of living in the country of their internship;</li>
            <li>Invites European companies to reimburse interns for necessary travel in association with the internship;</li>
            <li>Calls upon the DG EAC to advise Member States on improving national legislation regulating working conditions for interns;</li>
            <li>Requests the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) to appoint an independent expert team that will set standards for the rights of interns to be uphold throughout the EU and within EU organisations;</li>
            <li>Designates the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL) to create a database that outlines interns’ rights in the workplace;</li>
            <li>Further designates the DG EMPL to distribute this information to those who currently do or are set to do an internship;</li>
            <li>Urges the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofund) to promote paid internship opportunities through social media and advertisements on websites;</li>
            <li>Asks the European Investment Bank to invest in small and medium-sized enterprises that are unable to pay for internships independently.</li>
