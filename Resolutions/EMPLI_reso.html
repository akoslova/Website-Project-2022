        <h1>Motion for a Resolution by the Committee on Emplyment and Social Affairs I (EMPL I)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>Home, cheap home:</b> Irish taoiseach Micheál Martin called housing the “most urgent social issue facing our country” 
            but all across Europe, from Dublin to Athens, more and more people struggle to afford the rising costs of housing, especially young people. How can 
            the EU ensure access to decent and affordable housing as a human right for all Europeans?</em>
        </p>

        <p class="names"><br>Submitted by: Aoife Doyle (St Aloysius College Carrigtwohill), Darragh Halpin (St Joseph’s Rush), Saoirse Jaago (St. Attracta's 
            Community School),  Abby Lalor (Heywood Secondary School), Lauren Mallaghan (Mount Sackville), Kumayl Mustafa (St Francis College), Maeve O’Connell 
            (Christ King Secondary School), Róisín Myers (St.Marys, Mallow), Slater Paulak (Sandford Park), Liam Ramsay (Nord Anglia International School),

        </p>

        <p><br><b>The European Youth Parliament aims to mitigate the commodification of the urban housing market in order to ensure access to affordable and 
            adequate student accommodation, regulate rent prices across Member States, and provide social housing in a fair and equitable manner.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Because</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>There is a multitude of vacant and derelict homes across Europe with the average home vacancy rate at 18%,</li>
            <li>The commodification of the housing market has exacerbated the homelessness crisis which has resulted in more than 700 000 people sleeping rough on the streets in Europe,</li>
            <li>There is no incentive for landlords to keep rent prices affordable for people on an average or below average income,</li>
            <li>The cost and availability of student accommodation has become a deciding factor in whether young people attend third level education, due to student accommodation being unregulated both in price and in standards of living,</li>
            <li>The lack of equitable distribution of housing for refugees shows that the current system for social housing allocation is in need of reform,</li>
            <li>Exclusionary zoning laws and other similar regulations have reduced the supply of affordable homes being built;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The European Youth Parliament, to achieve these aims,</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Calls upon the heads of governments of Member States to meet on a five year basis in order to ensure they are working in line with the goals outlined in this resolution;</li>
            <li>Recommends Member States to adopt standardised regulations within and across Member States regarding the quality and availability of social housing;</li>
            <li>Suggests Member States implement a progressive tax on the value of land to reduce the amount of vacant and derelict properties;</li>
            <li>Encourages Member States to introduce the use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs) as seen in the UK and Ireland so long-term vacant homes can be bought and renovated for use as social housing;</li>
            <li>Urges local governments to cooperate with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to introduce schemes and policies, such as the Housing First model seen in Finland, that provide relief to the homeless population and people in precarious housing situations;</li>
            <li>Requests the European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) to provide housing grants to financially disadvantaged students regardless of their academic performance in order to provide equal opportunities to students of all backgrounds;</li>
            <li>Asks Member States to direct funding towards social housing that will:
                <ul>
                    <li>provide long term occupants of social housing the opportunity to buy the home which they occupy,</li>
                    <li>ensure secure and equal housing arrangements for refugees irrespective of citizenship;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Invites local governments to review zoning in their jurisdiction to enable the construction of more housing, particularly affordable housing such as starter homes and townhouses.</li>
