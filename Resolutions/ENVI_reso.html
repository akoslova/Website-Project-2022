        <h1>Motion for a Resolution by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>Moving to post-COVID health:</b> With the current pandemic, healthcare faced increased difficulties in accommodating 
            patients and delivering the care needed to citizens. Aware of the importance of a resilient health sector, how can the EU further strengthen the 
            healthcare infrastructure while ensuring a better prevention of future health crises?</em>
        </p>

        <p><br><b>The European Youth Parliament aims to better prepare and strengthen the healthcare infrastructure of Member States for future viruses as we 
            emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. We strive to support healthcare professionals, thus allowing them to perform their work more effectively. We wish 
            to encourage further development of digital health infrastructure to ensure that rural areas have equal access to healthcare.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Because</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Insufficient communication between Member States and the public, medical resources, and healthcare funding resulted in a lack of pandemic preparedness across Member States before the COVID-19 pandemic, </li>
            <li>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increased number of healthcare workers to suffer from mental illnesses, thus impeding them from providing optimal care for patients,</li>
            <li>A lack of appropriate infrastructure in Member States’ healthcare systems prevent a significant share of patients from being treated quickly and effectively,</li>
            <li>The incorporation of digital tools in healthcare has proven to be both efficient and beneficial to patients and healthcare providers by allowing patients in rural areas to access medical support,</li>
            <li>The ability for patients to get diagnosed digitally has reduced the traffic in hospitals, thus reducing the number of patients that healthcare staff have to deal with in person,</li>
            <li>Healthcare workers are subjected to subpar working conditions, such as extreme working hours and unsatisfactory wages,</li>
            <li>Inequalities among Member States and social classes have caused a disparity between citizens in access to healthcare;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The European Youth Parliament, to achieve these aims,</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Requests the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) to establish a convention with the purpose of sharing varying health information between Member States in order to further improve pandemic preparation procedures;</li>
            <li>Implores Member States to improve current mental health support systems for healthcare professionals through:
                <ul>
                    <li>the creation of a specialised helpline for medical staff,</li>
                    <li>the adoption of a policy capping the amount of consecutive working days for healthcare workers similar to the current system in Australia;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Encourages the European Union Public Health Association (EUPHA) to create and uphold a minimum standard for the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in hospitals across Member States;</li>
            <li>Urges Member States to launch a campaign to encourage the utilisation of technology in healthcare settings for healthcare staff and the public;</li>
            <li>Further requests the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA) to allocate further funding towards: 
                <ul>
                    <li>creating digital training programmes for medical practitioners,</li>
                    <li>researching medical technology;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Directs the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety to fund the replacement of outdated equipment in the healthcare sector with more modern alternatives;</li>
            <li>Asks Member States to introduce financial supports for inadequately paid healthcare workers;</li>
            <li>Further implores Member States to work closer with healthcare trade unions to further recognise the needs of healthcare workers;</li>
            <li>Strongly encourages Member States to offer financial incentives for healthcare providers to relocate them to understaffed areas and establish mobile primary care units.</li>
