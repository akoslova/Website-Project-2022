        <h1>Motion for a Resolution by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>LawForShe:</b> In September 2021, Members of the European Parliament suggested making gender-based violence a crime 
            under EU law, which would allow for common legal definitions, standards and minimum criminal penalties throughout the EU. With the number of women 
            who lose their lives to domestic violence every week in the EU increasing during lockdown and restrictions making the reporting process even more 
            difficult, how can a better EU framework be created across Europe to successfully combat gender-based violence?</em>
        </p>

        <p class="names"><br>Submitted by: Tom Andrews (Ardscoil na Mara, IE), Méabh Cantwell (Saint Aloysius’ College Carrigtwohill,IE), Éabha Coles (Scoil Pól, 
            IE), Jessica Collins (Our Lady’s Bower, IE), Naomi Conlon (Coláiste na Toirbhirte, IE), Rhiannon Finney (Sacred Heart Clonakilty, IE), Ella Joyce

        </p>

        <p><br><b>The European Youth Parliament aims to achieve a coordinated approach to eradicating gender-based violence. It further aims to educate the 
            European population, introduce a standard legal foundation across all Member States, and improve the support available to victims across all Member 
            States.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Because</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Social norms, patriarchal cultures, and certain religious beliefs can lead to the legitimisation of gender-based violence in society,</li>
            <li>Many women victims of gbv lack awareness of the reporting procedures in case of assault, with 19% of women are unaware of the supports available to them,</li>
            <li>The legal definition of rape differs between Member States, resulting in unequal procedural treatment,</li>
            <li>Victims may face obstacles within the justice system such as re-traumatisation, prolonged court proceedings, and victim blaming,</li>
            <li>Not all Member States have ratified the Istanbul Convention with some expressing desires to leave,</li>
            <li>Certain disadvantaged groups, such as LGBTQ+ women, women of colour, and disabled women are more likely to be victims of gender-based violence,</li>
            <li>Many Member States do not have an adequate number of shelters for victims of gender-based violence,</li>
            <li>A lack of education and societal stigma results in many people not being able to recognise the signs of gender-based violence both with themselves and in their surroundings;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The European Youth Parliament, to achieve these aims,</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Urges Member States to introduce workshops on consent, bystander intervention, and gender-based violence in post-primary national curricula;</li>
            <li>Designates the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) to undertake an assessment of the disproportionate effects of gender-based violence on disadvantaged groups and develop targeted measures for the groups in question to present to the European Commission;</li>
            <li>Invites the European Commission to extend the Mutual Learning Programme on Gender Equality to:
                <ul>
                    <li>facilitate a knowledge-sharing conference on best practice in court proceedings,</li>
                    <li>create a database of supports available to victims;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Supports the European Commission’s recent Proposal for a Directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence coordinating Member States’ legal efforts for combating gender-based violence;</li>
            <li>Calls upon the Directorate-General on Employment and Social Affairs (DG-EMPL) to create a fund for Member States to support their construction of shelters for victims of gender-based violence;</li>
            <li>Encourages those Member States who have not ratified the Istanbul Convention, such as Bulgaria, Czechia, and Hungary, to do so;</li>
            <li>Asks the European Institute on Gender Equality (EIGE) to introduce a multimedia campaign highlighting the signs of domestic violence, and how to recognise and report them;</li>
            <li>Instructs the European Commission to use The third EU health programme to increase supports for victims of gender-based violence through:
                <ul>
                    <li>aiding the development of telemedicine services,</li>
                    <li>providing counselling services in conjunction with court proceedings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
