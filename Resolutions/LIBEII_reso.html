        <h1>Motion for a Resolution by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs II (LIBE II)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>Unbreaking the news:</b> The press and media in the EU are under threat from political interference and takeovers by 
            media giants. As media freedom and pluralism are fundamental EU values, the European Commission plans to enact a Media Freedom Act later in 2022. 
            With details still being developed, how should it ensure independence and resilience for the EU media market?</em>
        </p>

        <p class="names"><br>Submitted by: Rian Conway (Colaiste an Spioraid Naoimh, Jack Brady, St Vincents Glasnevin, IE), Eoin Mulhern (Scoil Mhuire Buncrana 
            IE), Zara Daly (Gortnor Abbey, IE), Joshua Aspinall (Hazelwood College, IE), Anushka Pathak (Sligo Grammar School, IE), Siun Cummins (Scoil Mhuire

        </p>

        <p><br><b>The European Youth Parliament aims to reduce mechanisms of governmental and other political influence in the media sphere by enabling instruments 
            for financial independence of journalists and media outlets. We bring attention to the serious cases of misinformation and their negative effects 
            while actively working on media literacy from an early age through education. Finally, the resolution puts focus on the safety and protective 
            mechanisms of journalists and their work.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Because</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP) play a role in silencing independent journalism,</li>
            <li>The lack of representation of minorities in the media may lead to increased discrimination of these communities,</li>
            <li>Political entities tend to influence media according to their own agenda or interests,</li>
            <li>Certain Member States, such as Hungary, experience high levels of media market concentration and anti-pluralism,</li>
            <li>Journalists face a constant and intense danger of violence and harassment, leading to  a potential chilling effect,</li>
            <li>Anti-democratic government tactics may lead to suppression of press freedom and even censorship,</li>
            <li>The spread of misinformation and disinformation in digital and traditional media can be accelerated by a lack of media liability and falling journalistic ethical standards;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The European Youth Parliament, to achieve these aims,</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Calls upon the European Commission to enact an anti-SLAPP directive to protect citizens from intimidation, censorship, and silencing by:
                <ul>
                    <li>allowing the defendant to file a motion to dismiss the suit,</li>
                    <li>putting the burden of proof on the plaintiff to prove that they have enough evidence to result in a favourable suit,</li>
                    <li>making the plaintiff pay for the defendant's attorney fees if the suit is unsuccessful;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Encourages Member States to update their national legislation on media liability to oblige media companies that have spread mis- and disinformation to appropriately compensate for the negative consequences caused by said content;   </li>
            <li>Urges the European Commission to extend the scope of the Special Committees on External Interference in all Democratic Processes in the EU to include the internal affairs, with a focus on political disinformation on the internet and in damaging effects on democratic ideals;</li>
            <li>Invites the European Commission to provide financial support and expertise to pre-existing fact-checking journalistic services, as well as current education programmes improving journalistic integrity;/li>
            <li>Approves the successful work of Journalismfund.eu on advancing independent investigative journalism across the EU;</li>
            <li>Asks the European Commission to provide funding for media outlets dedicating a substantial part of their coverage to topical events from the perspective of minority communities;</li>
            <li>Further encourages all Member States to establish educational programmes on media literacy in their public educational institutions;</li>
            <li>Strongly urges the European Commission to subsidise the media outlets undergoing political  pressure and threat of the legal and financial consequences;</li>
            <li>Instructs Member States to cooperate with the Alliance of Independent Press Councils of Europe (AIPCE) to implement further safety measures to ensure journalists’ freedom within the EU;</li>
            <li>Directs the European Commission to condemn countries that have directly violated Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR);</li>
            <li>Further invites Member States to amend the existing  legislation on the protection of journalists by introducing the special focus on online safety, digital empowerment, and support for women and journalist in minority groups.</li>
