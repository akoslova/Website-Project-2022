        <h1>Motion for a Resolution by the Committee on Regional Development (REGI)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>All in this together?</b> Regional inequalities remain a pervasive problem in European cohesion, with disparities in 
            income, wellbeing, and living standards existing both between and within Member States. As the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) focuses on 
            building a more competitive and greener future for Europe in 2021-2027, how can the EU ensure this future is enjoyed equally across the European 
            regions?</em>
        </p>

        <p><br><b>The European Youth Parliament aims to increase the standard of living for citizens in all regions across the EU. We aim to do this by making 
            healthcare more accessible, affordable and catered to the needs of specific regions. We aim to ensure quality education is accessible to everyone. 
            Furthermore, we strive to develop sustainable infrastructure and public transport systems to allow further economic development in disadvantaged 
            regions. We aim to establish an equitable distribution of funds and combat the misuse of European Cohesion funds. Consequently,  we will advocate for 
            the creation of sustainable and equal employment opportunities across all EU regions.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Because</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Tertiary education opportunities are concentrated in urban areas, with only 18% having a tertiary education in rural areas compared to 35% in urban areas,</li>
            <li>Quality and accessibility of education differ between both regions and Member States,</li>
            <li>Less-developed regions find it more difficult to reach sustainability goals and implement Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) standards because they are more reliant on unsustainable resources,</li>
            <li>There is a lack of quality and variety in infrastructure and sustainable transport in less-developed areas,</li>
            <li>Only 60% of rural household have access to high-speed internet, compared to EU’s total average of 86%,</li>
            <li>The lack of sufficient public infrastructure in disadvantaged regions cannot accommodate the employment of high-income individuals resulting in a brain drain out of the region,</li>
            <li>Varying labour costs across regions that are at risk of poverty and lack employment opportunities often lead to economic migration,</li>
            <li>Citizens in infrastructurally deprived regions live up to 7 and a half years less than the EU average, partly due to inadequate access to healthcare facilities,</li>
            <li>Failure to adequately audit and monitor expenditures within the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) leads to the misuse of funds,</li>
            <li>EU Cohesion Policy has become increasingly focused on more developed and urban regions which creates a wider disparity amongst Member States and their regions;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The European Youth Parliament, to achieve these aims,</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Suggests Member States provide financial support for school facilities and school buses in rural areas;</li>
            <li>Recommends the European University Association (EUA) to further facilitate cooperation between European universities in order to harmonise the quality of education;</li>
            <li>Instructs the Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO) to fund affordable housing specifically for students coming from rural areas through ERDF funding;</li>
            <li>Urges DG REGIO to further utilise the ERDF to fund renewable energy sources in regions predominantly reliant on unsustainable energy sources such as fossil fuels;</li>
            <li>Encourages Member States to stimulate industry in rural areas by:
                <ul>
                    <li>introducing hiring quotas that require large corporations to employ people living in rural areas and offer them remote working opportunities,</li>
                    <li>funding co-working spaces in rural areas;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Encourages Member States to develop and expand public transport in remote areas through ERDF funding;</li>
            <li>Requests DG REGIO to prioritise the infrastructural needs of disadvantaged and rural regions over already well developed urban regions when allocating Cohesion funding; </li>
            <li>Invites the European Investment Bank (EIB) to ensure access to secure and affordable connectivity for all households through the Connecting Europe Broadband Fund by:
                <ul>
                    <li>investing in broadband development in less-developed regions,</li>
                    <li>improving digital facilities in public spaces such as libraries;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Requests Member States utilise ERDF resources to increase the funding allocated to healthcare  facilities in their less-developed regions by:
                <ul>
                    <li>building additional facilities to provide easier access to rural areas,</li>
                    <li>creating mobile care units,</li>
                    <li>providing helicopter care units;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Urges the DG REGIO to utilise the European Union Statistics on Living Conditions (EU-SILC) to fairly allocate funds to EU regions by means of the ERDF;</li>
            <li>Further urges the European Court of Auditors (ECA) to better monitor and audit the usage of funds given to Member States to ensure that they are being adequately used;</li>
            <li>Calls upon the national and regional authorities to hold recipients of Cohesion Policy funding accountable for the misuse of funding;</li>
            <li>Calls upon DG REGIO to subsidise businesses in disadvantaged regions through the European Cohesion Fund in order to provide competitive wages.</li>
