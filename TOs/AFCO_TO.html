        <p class="topic_sentence"><em><b>The kids are (not) alright:</b> While young Europeans are politically engaging for ends like Fridays for Future or Black Lives Matter, the minimum age to 
            vote - a basic aspect of political participation - remains 18 in almost all Member States. Considering that the European Parliament already recommended 
            lowering the voting age in 2015, how can the EU finally enhance these rights for young people?</em>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>At the European Parliament elections in 2019, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/files/be-heard/eurobarometer/2019/post-election-survey-2019-complete-results/report/en-post-election-survey-2019-report.pdf">
            voter turnout reached a record high of 50.6%</a>. This was largely attributed to the increased participation 
            of young people, with the number of voters under the age of 25 having increased by 14 percent from the previous election. For the majority of Member 
            States, those eligible to vote were above the age of 18. This excludes a key sector of society who have been engaging in <b>civil and political 
            participation activities</b>. While young people involve themselves in activism, they are unable to access the most basic civic duty that is voting. 
            This creates an <b>imbalance</b> in the <b>voices which are heard</b> by politicians as they are more likely to  prioritise the issues of those who got them elected.
        </p>
        <p><br>
            The popular justification for lowering the voting age is engagement in other civic duties, such as paying taxes: as youngsters can be employed, but 
            cannot vote, this can be seen as taxation without representation. Additionally, the concept of voting power comes into play as young people are 
            traditionally underrepresented in government, due to <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/eurobarometre/2014/post/post_ee2014_sociodemographic_annex_en.pdf">
            low voter turnout among the young demographic</a>. The over-65-year-old demographic has been 
            overrepresented, due to high voter turnout. Offering more young people the opportunity to vote has been shown to decrease this gap between these two 
            groups. Additionally, the argument has been made that young people will face the consequences of a vote for a longer period of time. For example 
            during the Brexit referendum, <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/meet-the-75-young-people-who-voted-to-remain-in-eu">
            75% of young people voted to remain in the EU</a>, yet they were overpowered by the older generations who voted to leave.
        </p>

        <h2>Keywords</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Age of majority:</b> The age at which someone is legally considered an adult. In European countries this is typically 18, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/50/section/1">
                however it is 16 in Scotland</a> unlike the rest of the UK.</li>
            <li><b>Suffrage:</b> The right to vote in political elections.</li>
            <li><b>Political Participation:</b> The activities of citizens that attempt to influence the structure of government, the selection of government 
                officials, or the policies of the government. Examples include signing petitions, voting in elections, participating in interest groups, running 
                for office, protesting, and emailing government officials.</li>
            <li><b>Minimum voting age:</b> The minimum age established by law that a person must be before they become eligible to vote in a public election. 
                Most commonly this is 18.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p><b>Member States:</b> It is the Member States who determine the voting ages in their local and national elections and referendums. The EU is not within 
            competence to force Member States to lower the minimum voting age. Instead, it is upon the Member States to implement such a constitutional change. 
            Certain European political parties <a href="https://europeangreens.eu/node/12480/content/privacy-policy">such as the Greens</a> as well as individual politicians have been lobbying to lower the voting ages across the EU to 
            ensure and strengthen the youth vote.
        </p>

        <p><br><b>European Commission:</b> The European Commission is the legislative branch of the EU and <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thenetherlands/resource/static/files/pdf/rosanna-sophie-zwolsman---suffrage-for-sixteen-year-olds-within-the-eu.pdf">
            is able to propose legislation</a> to lower the minimum voting 
            age across European elections. They would first have to assess the possible social and economic consequences of creating such a policy before 
            submitting the proposal to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU for review, debate and voting. 
        </p>

        <p><br><b>Young People:</b> Young people are the key stakeholder and are most affected by this issue as they are limited in the ways by which they can 
            advocate for this change in voting law. Some key organisations that represent youth interests such as the <a href="https://www.youthforum.org/"><b>European Youth Forum</b></a> 
            and its associated 
            councils and organisations actively lobby the Member States’ governments on behalf of the youth who are ineligible to vote. Young people regularly 
            display their desire to partake in political discourse through their activism such as leading movements like Fridays for Future,but cannot fully 
            enforce change as they cannot choose their own parliamentary representation.</p>

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p>While the <b>majority of the EU has set the minimum voting age at 18</b> this has some exceptions. <b>Austria</b> was the first Member State to introduce teen 
            suffrage in 2007, allowing them to vote in national elections. Moreover, 16 and 17-year-old Austrian voters are able to vote in European elections. 
            Teen suffrage has been <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2018/09/11/what-does-voting-at-16-change-the-case-of-austria"><b>for the most part successful in 
            Austria</b></a>: while the 16-17-year-old demographic was less represented in the polls than those aged 
            30 and over, it does have a bigger turnout than the 18-21-year-olds. This has been <b>supported by education policy measures</b> such as mandatory civic 
            education classes to promote political maturity. Other countries such as <a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/minag?dataSource=MINAG_en_65998&media=png&width=740&topic=group03&question=MINAG_PP03&plot=MAP&subset=NONE&subsetValue=NONE&answer=MINAG_PP03&year=2017">
            Greece, Malta,</a> and <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/163599/bill-introduced-to-allow-voting-for-european-elections-from-age-of-16-in-belgium-guillaume-defosse-kristof-calvo-egbert-lachaert-patrick-dewael-eu-open-vld-green-party-ps">Belgium</a> 
            have followed in Austria’s footsteps. Greece has 
            given 17-year-olds the right to vote in European elections and Belgium has introduced a bill that allows 16-year-olds to vote in European elections 
            in 2024.
        </p>

        <p><br>In 2015, the European Parliament <a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&reference=2015/2035(INL)">recommended Member States to lower the voting age to 16</a>. 
            While some states followed the recommendation, such as the 
            ones mentioned above, the majority did not lower its voting age. 
        </p>

        <p><br>In other Member States such as Estonia and some of Germany’s federal states, the voting age has been lowered to 16 for <b>local elections</b>. This has been 
            argued to be an effective measure as it guarantees <b>limited teenage suffrage</b> and the action of <b>casting a vote during your formative years</b> has shown to 
            be <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17457289.2012.718280">essential in ensuring voter participation in your later years</a>. While it is not total enfranchisement, it has been effective in creating this “habit” 
            of voting. During the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pa/article/74/3/563/6320902">75% of registered 16- and 17-year-olds turned out to vote</a> following a once-off allowance 
            for them to participate. The UK <a href=" http://www.votesat16.org/"><b>“Vote at 16” coalition campaign</b></a> has been lobbying since 1998 to ensure this right for young people through their 
            vast network of supportive politicians and organisations. From this one off they were able to further campaign and in 2015 a bill ensuring voting 
            rights to 16 year olds was passed in the Scottish Parliament.

        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p>One of the major challenges to lowering the minimum age of voting is the <b>strong opposition</b> it faces. Many simply believe 16-year-olds are too <b>young, 
            impulsive, lacking political knowledge and too easily influenced</b> to be allowed to vote. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2017/jun/13/too-young-to-vote-the-science-of-maturity">
            Many believe that these teenagers are <b>too idealistic</b></a> and do 
            not have enough life experience to be able to make sound political decisions about their stance on tax, housing, the economy, etc. Seeing as humans 
            <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110922134617.htm">do not fully mature until the age of 25</a> (when their brains have fully developed) the case has also been made to instead raise the minimum voting age 
            instead of lowering it. With people holding such strong opposition it can be difficult for young people to gain the support needed to enact this 
            change.
        </p>

        <p><br>The <b>age of majority</b> is a key conflict in this issue also as many believe voting to be a key right one should receive as an adult not before. In the 
            <a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2017/mapping-minimum-age-requirements/age-majority">majority of European countries</a>, this is set at the age of 18. Prior to the 1970s, the majority of western countries had 
            <a href=" https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/consultation%20papers/wpAgeofMajority.htm#:~:text=This%20recommendation%20was%20accepted%20and,1969%2C%20for%20Northern%20Ireland.)">set this age of majority at 
            21</a>. However, following the move to lower the voting age to 18 the age of majority was also lowered. It has remained at this age, as it is usually the 
            age one completes secondary education and leaves home,essentially entering adulthood. While this is a <b>social construct</b>, not a biological one, it 
            remains a strong argument against lowering the voting age. After all, young people below the age of 18 are not considered adults and voting is seen as 
            an adult activity.
        </p>

        <p><br>There is also the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/28/young-people-bad-voting-millennials-eu-vote-politics">element of disparity in voting trends</a>. Older generations may be <b>apprehensive of the political shift</b> that could occur if young 
            people are included in the electorate and thus may not support teen suffrage. This creates a cycle of the youth not engaging in the vote and the 
            older generations maintaining their unequal political voting power. Equally, there is a divide between regularly engaged activist teens and the less 
            politically engaged youth who are typically <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/faculteiten/en/faculteit-der-maatschappij-en-gedragswetenschappen/news/2021/02/why-voting-as-early-as-16-is-much-better.html?cb">
            less educated and do not live in cities</a>. While the lowered voting age could help bring these young 
            people into the fold, many are wary of the potential political ramifications of this.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p>To conclude, while there are many valid reasons to lower the minimum voting age the proposal faces considerable opposition. Despite the vocal actions 
            of young activists coupled with the longstanding recommendation to lower the voting age, 7 years later only 4 Member States have taken the initiative 
            to do so. 
        </p>
        
        <p><br><b>Questions to consider:</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Considering the longstanding association of casting a vote with maturity and adulthood, what steps can be taken to placate the worry of 
                <b>young people making ill-informed political decisions</b>?</li>
            <li>Following the increase of youth participation in the 2019 European Election what further <b>encouragement</b> can be given to young people to 
                <b>participate in politics</b>? </li>
            <li>Seeing as older generations are reluctant to offer more young people the vote, what actions can be taken to ensure young people get their 
                voices heard and opinions considered? 
            </li>
        </ol>
