            to remote learning and drew attention to the role of digital technologies in education. With artificial intelligence (AI) currently high on the

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Never has there been a more dire need for remote learning to be introduced in schools around Europe than at the beginning of the <b>COVID-19 
            pandemic</b>. Teachers employed in all types of educational institutions, from primary school to universities, turned to digital platforms for help. 
            As a result, the world discovered that artificial intelligence (AI) systems offer practical support for remote learning and teaching. 
        </p>

        <p><br>The current connection between AI and education in Europe can be categorised into these three areas: the use of AI-powered tools in class, 
            learning about AI, and preparing for AI by making students better understand the impact of AI. Such systems have the potential to offer 
            <b>personalised learning experiences</b> for students while <b>automating</b> some of the teachers’ routine tasks (such as grading). However, 
            while the benefits of AI are promising, the impact of AI on educational systems as well as the future of the interactions between students and 
            teachers in such settings are still ambiguous. Some worry that in remote learning supported by AI, <b>student-teacher interaction becomes obsolete</b>
             which ultimately has a profound impact on students’ satisfaction and learning outcomes. Others raise concern over the fact that AI teaching 
             systems have the ability to collect and process <b>personal data and sensitive information</b>. </p>

        <h2>Keywords</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Remote learning</b> represents a broad term which includes any type of learning that happens outside of a traditional classroom, with the 
                teacher not present in the same location as the students, and which is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/whats-working-well-in-remote-education/whats-working-well-in-remote-education">
                    made possible through technology</a>. Remote learning has therefore paved the way for AI in education during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person 
                    lessons suddenly became too dangerous.</li>
            <li><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> is a term coined in the 1950s that has over time accumulated many different definitions. When talking about 
                remote learning with the help of AI, we refer to machines that have the <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf">
                    ability to learn as well as be context-aware</a>. </li>
            <li>A broader term is the <b>information and communication technologies (ICT)</b> representing the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/ICT-information-and-communications-technology-or-technologies">
                internet-enabled wireless networks</a> as well as older forms of communication technologies such as the landline. When a certain group of people has limited access to ICTs, then a digital divide comes about. </li>
            <li><b>Digital divide</b> is described as the <a href="http://www.digitaldividecouncil.com/what-is-the-digital-divide/">gap between individuals who have access
                 to ICTs and those who do not</a>. This divide can be viewed through the lense of gender, social status, as well as physical impairments or the lack thereof.  
            </li>
            <li><b>Educational systems</b> encompass different types of educational institutions in a certain country. These institutions function in accordance 
                with both local and international agreements (such as the Bologna Process). 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p><b>Education in the European Union (EU)</b> falls under the Union’s supporting competence, meaning that the EU can only intervene to 
            <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=LEGISSUM:ai0020">support, coordinate or 
            complement</a> the action of Member States in the field. Despite this, there are several EU institutions and stakeholders working in the area of 
            education. For instance, the goal of the <b>European Education Area (EEA)</b> is to <a href="https://education.ec.europa.eu/about">improve the quality of education</a> 
            and training available in Member States, with one of its key areas of improvement being digital education. The European Commission works together 
            with Member States to achieve their collective vision on the EEA. In order to choose and implement the best solutions for education in 
            Europe, the <b>European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA)</b> is in charge of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/european-education-and-culture-executive-agency_en">selecting and providing funding for projects</a>
             in the field of education that benefit all EU citizens.
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>When faced with the fact that digital technologies have become an essential part of the educational process, both <b>teachers and students</b>
             alike experience something called a <b>generational digital divide</b>. Students, especially those in high school, grew up learning how to use 
             modern technology, but their teachers lack certain knowledge when it comes to new software or sometimes even hardware. Realising that teachers and 
             students represent the main pillars of education could help make future legislation more people-oriented.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>On the EU level, the <b><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/education-youth-sport-and-culture_en#responsibilities">Directorate-General for Education and Culture (EAC)</a></b>
            , is the main department responsible for EU policy on education. It develops and carries out the Commission’s policies and initiatives. At the same time, the 
            <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en"><b>Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (CONNECT)</b></a> develops policies, 
            research, and innovation in the EU with the aim of creating a Europe ‘fit for the digital age’. Above all, <b>Ministries of Education as well as Ministries of 
            Research</b> of respective Member States represent important links between new proposals and their implementation, since Member States reserve the right to 
            organise education and training as they see fit. Bearing in mind that digital technologies are a lucrative area, private companies have a role to play. The 
            <b>Google for Education EU Digital Support Fund</b> is designed to <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/supporting-digital-education-in-europe/">
            help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)</a> that support Member States’ national digital education transformation programmes. Google offers SMEs 
            the possibility to apply for funding in order to carry out their programs as well as get Google’s digital equipment and software. 
        </p>

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p>Not many measures that include the link between AI and education exist, however, one of the first documents to mention the urgency of using 
            <b>technology’s potential in education</b> is “<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52008DC0425">
            Schools — EU agenda to improve competences and learning for the 21st century</a>”. This paper was drafted in 2008 by the EAC, and it identifies 
            new technologies as an asset to enabling young people to fully develop for their future.
        </p>
        
        <p><br>
            In February of 2021, the European Commission established a framework for setting up six new executive agencies that will be in charge of 
            <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=legissum%3A4509908">implementing EU programmes</a> in their respective fields 
            (infrastructure, research, health, education, culture etc.) until 2028. One of which is the European Health and Digital Executive Agency in 
            charge of implementing the <b><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme">Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL)</a></b>. This programme is designed to provide funding in key areas including AI.   
        </p>

        <p><br>In April of 2021, the Commission proposed the first-ever legal framework on AI called the <b><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206">Artificial Intelligence Act</a></b>. 
            The aim of this document is to address the risks of AI and ensure that Europeans can trust what AI has to offer them. The Commission's research and innovation policy on artificial 
            intelligence focuses on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key-enabling-technologies/artificial-intelligence-ai_en#relatedlinks">
            developing and deploying AI solutions</a> that have positive impacts on the lives of European citizens. At the same time, 
            the <a href="https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital/education-action-plan"><b>Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027)</b></a> represents a policy 
            initiative set out to support the sustainable adaptation of the education and training systems of Member States to the 
            digital age. This initiative underlines the importance of having an education system resilient to disruptions such as the 
            COVID-19 pandemic. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Member States have all individually implemented digital learning programmes to make sure children could continue 
            with their education. Some of the <a href="https://www.itu.int/hub/2020/05/covid-19-how-digital-learning-solutions-are-taking-shape/">
            most successful examples</a> include Spain’s <b>Educlan</b> platform supported by the Ministry of Education of Spain, 
            France’s <b>Ma classe à la maison</b> or Switzerland’s <b>Eduport</b> website. All of these platforms were created 
            in collaboration with teacher unions and the respective Ministries of Education offering students the chance to 
            access interactive lessons online as well as through Smart TV apps.  
        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p>It is believed by some that well-coordinated use of AI can bring about significant improvements to society. It can 
            help the Union reach climate and sustainability goals and introduce high-impact innovations to healthcare, 
            education, transport, industry, and many other sectors. The Commission is determined to make this 
            <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age_en">Europe's “Digital Decade”</a>, when Europe must 
            strengthen its digital sovereignty and set standards.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            When focusing on the positives we frequently list advantages of modern technologies, such as having a more 
            <b>interactive learning experience</b>, accessing an <b>unlimited amount of information</b> or 
            acquiring <b>digital literacy</b>. Another essential characteristic of using AI in education is that AI ‘works 
            around the clock’ and never tires, unlike people. 
        </p><br>

        <p><br>
            At the same time, the uptake of AI entails a number of potential risks and has the potential to bring about 
            considerable changes to the way we view education. The instantaneous introduction of modern technologies to the 
            classroom due to the COVID-19 pandemic is frequently condemned  for having negative consequences, including the 
            <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-do-educational-systems-ignore-technological-istiqur-rahman">widening of an already existing social gap</a></b>. 
            When education relies on information and communication technologies (ICTs) the <b>digital divide</b> becomes more prominent.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            With AI offering student-tailored instruction, some argue that teachers’ roles may shift toward <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327267609_I_teacher_using_artificial_intelligence_AI_and_social_robots_in_communication_and_instruction"><b>overseers</b></a> 
            who solely design and select AI-led exercises and monitor student progress, instead of facilitators who lead their 
            own lessons. On the other hand, AI enables teachers and educators of all kinds to better analyse the needs of 
            their students and therefore implement the theory of <b>multiple intelligences (MI)</b> in the way they teach.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Furthermore, teaching methods that solely rely on digital technologies could be connected to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-do-educational-systems-ignore-technological-istiqur-rahman">
            increase in the number of students suffering from mental illness</a>, and the regression of young people’s 
            cognitive and academic development. Aside from these factors, the <b>cost of maintaining modern technology</b> often gets 
            overlooked as well as the ability of AI teaching systems to <b>collect and process sensitive information</b>
             such as personalised student numbers as well as scanned documents. 
        </p>

        <h2>The Scientific Background</h2>

        <p>
            Artificial intelligence combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving. AI also 
            encompasses two sub-fields: machine learning and deep learning. <b>Machine learning</b> as a sub-category of AI, focuses 
            on <a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/what-is-machine-learning.html">teaching computers</a> how to learn from data and improve with experience. The more data the computer processes, 
            the more it learns and improves its performance. <b>Deep learning</b> relies on neural networks to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/deep-learning">
            mimic the behaviour of the human brain</a>. Most common examples of deep learning applications are digital assistants, 
            voice-enabled TV remotes, and credit card fraud detection. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to 
            create expert systems that can <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence">make predictions or classifications based on given data</a>. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            According to one classification, AI can be split into two groups: <b>weak</b> (narrow) AI and <b>strong</b> AI. 
            Narrow AI is the most common type of AI today. Apple’s built-in assistant Siri is an example of this, along with 
            other automated chat-bots and programmes for automated grading. At the moment, strong AI is only theoretical. When 
            strong or general AI is achieved, machines will have the ability to learn from their past experiences and plan for 
            the future as well as the ability to reason or display common sense, all traits associated only with humans.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p>It seems as though the use of AI will have to become more prevalent and better defined within European education systems with the effects of the 
            COVID-19 pandemic still making it difficult for both teachers and students to participate in “traditional” classes. Moreover, hybrid-learning has 
            been shown to benefit those in need of more flexible learning arrangements due to e.g. illness or family commitments. The main challenge is 
            <b>finding balance</b> in utilising the benefits of AI while still allowing teachers to tailor their lessons and their approach to educating. 
            Another concern relates to both the mental and physical health of teachers and students which comes under risk during remote learning. The 
            <b>digital divide</b> further deepens the social gap that becomes apparent when education relies on ICTs.
        </p>


        
        <p><br><b>Questions to consider:</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>How can the EU contribute to the development of technologies that assist learning while balancing the <b>benefits and threats of AI</b>?</li>
            <li>What role should AI play in the grand scheme of things when it comes to the goals the EU set for its <b>digital development</b>?</li>
            <li>How should Member States approach the prospect of digital technologies in education to become better prepared for <b>future disruptions to their education systems</b>?</li>
            <li>How does remote learning shape the <b>students’ experience of education</b> and what role does AI play?</li>
            <li>How can the EU ensure that every student has the <b>means to access</b> digital educational services? </li>
        </ol>
