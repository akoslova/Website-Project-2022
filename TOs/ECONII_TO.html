        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Between 2020-2022, the EU has initiated a number of efforts to mitigate the <b>public health effects and financial repercussions</b> of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
            The European Commission coordinated the joint buying of vaccines and medical equipment for the Member States. The European Central Bank (ECB) robustly increased 
            its purchasing of government and corporate bonds. Likewise, the EU took the <b>extraordinary decision</b> in 2020 to drastically increase the size of its common c
            apital markets bond issuance programmes, in order to finance the Union’s economic recovery post-pandemic. As a result of the “Corona bonds”, a total of €806.9 
            billion will be made available to the Member States to finance <b>common goals</b> of climate neutrality, digitalisation, public health resilience, and gender equality. 
            The money is accorded to the Member States through the <b>NextGenerationEU programme and The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF)</b>. To be eligible for funding, 
            Member States must spend a minimum 37% and 20% of allotted money on climate and digitisation projects respectively. Yet, the EU’s post-Covid-19 recovery programme has been 
            criticised for being both too ambitious and not ambitious enough. Detractors say the issuing of Corona bonds, which encumber all Member States with 
            <b>billions in new government debt</b> regardless of previous economic performance, risk <a href="https://www.ispionline.it/en/pubblicazione/next-generation-eu-common-debt-tackle-crisis-29946">hindering the growth potential of high-productivity countries</a>. 
            Sceptics say the <a href="https://www.wwf.eu/?4968966/COP26-the-EU-must-step-up-on-climate-at-home-and-away"><b>funding appropriated for climate projects is too low</b></a>, and that the EU is missing a once in a generation opportunity to concretely commit to the Paris 
            Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to below 2°C. 
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p><b>The European Commission</b>, led by President Ursula von der Leyen, has been a vocal supporter throughout the COVID-19 pandemic of further EU cooperation and coordination. In consultation 
            with the European Council, the Commission brought the RRF to life in February 2021, ensuring joint Union-wide financing for post-pandemic reforms in the Member States. The von der Leyen Commission has 
            likewise argued the need for European unity to meet major continental and global challenges and crises, including climate change and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Treaty of Lisbon clarifies 
            the areas in which the EU – and European Commission – <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Aai0020">retains the competency to act and propose legislation</a>.
        </p>

        <p><br><b>The European Central Bank (ECB)</b> used non-standard policy measures throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to combat the risk of economic depression and extensive unemployment, 
            including engaging in large-scale quantitative easing (QE). Under its’ €1850 billion pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the ECB bought a myriad of assets from banks, 
            companies and governments to ensure liquidity and stability in the European financial system. The ECB’s use of non-standard policy measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, as 
            throughout the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and Eurozone debt crisis of 2010-2013, provides European capital markets with additional cash and credit assets to mitigate the 
            effects of financial recession and negate broad price fluctuations.
        </p>

        <p><br><b>Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO)</b> serves as the European Commission’s organ for the deliverance of relief aid 
            to populations affected by natural disasters and man-made crises. DG ECHO directs a European and global network of field offices and is the body responsible for carrying out 
            operations under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to aid countries in need of emergency relief assistance. DG ECHO is currently involved in coordinating the distribution of 
            material aid to Ukraine following the Russian invasion of the country in February 2022.
        </p>

        <p><br><b>Member States’ governments</b> are responsible for the implementation and execution of national response plans in times of crisis. In regards to COVID-19, Member States’ 
            governments faced the decision on how best respond to the pandemic, with some opting for nationwide lockdowns while others chose more relaxed public health measures, such as temporarily 
            limiting public gatherings and recommending social distancing. To receive NextGenerationEU funding, Member State governments are required to adhere to a number of <a href="https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/view/9781526148346/9781526148346.00010.xml">commonly agreed criteria</a>
            , and send in national plans detailing how they aim to spend their allocated recovery funds. A number of Member State governments, including France and Germany, have supported 
            the creation of new political tools to better coordinate future EU crisis management.
        </p>

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p>
            Core to the changing discourse on European financial cooperation and integration is the newfound <b>acceptance of taking on common debt in the Union</b> through the selling of 
            <b>joint bonds</b>. On behalf of the EU, the European Commission is committed to borrowing a minimum of €750 billion on international capital markets to finance post-pandemic 
            recovery reforms. While not a unique arrangement, pre-pandemic outstanding common bond debt amounted to a total of €52 billion, <a href="https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/EconPol_Policy_Report_28_Common_Debt_Issuance.pdf">less 
            than a tenth the size of the NextGenerationEU programme</a>. Member States gain access to NextGenerationEU funding through the RRF, which delivers approved capital on the basis 
            of submitted national plans. The plans must include measures to <b><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/recovery-coronavirus/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en#scoreboard">“advance green and digital transitions and make Member States’ economies and societies more resilient.”</a></b> 
            Funding is continuously approved by the RRF. Member States are able to <b>consecutively be permitted NextGenerationEU resources up until 2026</b>, should the current RRF mandate not be 
            prolonged. RRF funding is further performance-based, and regular payments require recipient states to adhere to their target milestones and make efforts to achieve <b>country-specific fiscal 
            and policy recommendations</b> set out by the European Semester. All Member States, except the Netherlands, have so far <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/publications/datasets/european-union-countries-recovery-and-resilience-plans/">submitted national plans</a> 
            which have received approval from the European Commission.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            While current focus lies on a resilient post-pandemic rebuilding effort, other policies and measures exist to meet separate types of global hazards. 
            <b>As extreme weather, environmental degradation and sea-level rise increases as a consequence of the climate crisis</b>, the EU regularly prepares overviews of 
            natural and human-induced disaster risks to practically model necessary changes in risk management policy. Through the <b><a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/eu-civil-protection-mechanism-factsheet-last-updated-15012020">EU Civil Protection Mechanism</a></b>
            , a DG ECHO responsibility area, 33 states (including all EU countries and 6 additional participating nations) exchange information on estimates of current and future 
            disaster risk. The EU Civil Protection Mechanism in like manner provides funding for projects in the Member States aiming to heighten disaster risk prevention capabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p>The EU continues to suffer from <b><a href="https://www.ceps.eu/how-robust-is-the-eu-recovery/">institutional obstacles</a></b> in pursuing a coherent and concerted 
            response to global challenges. Yet change seems to be the theme of the future; the introduction of comprehensive common debt, which the European Commissions aims to 
            repay by 2058 the earliest, and mechanisms to bypass the once believed impassable necessity of unanimity in decision-making signal giants move too, albeit slowly. Still, 
            key to creating sustainable and vigorous answers to future global hazards and disasters for the Union will be <b>observing whether or not the current winds of change are temporary</b>. 
            Likewise, it remains to be seen if Member States receiving RRF funding continue to comply with targets and reforms advancing climate-friendly and digitisation efforts in the years to come. 
            While the European Commission and Member States’ governments claim 40% of NextGenerationEU grants and loans will go towards a green transition, 
            <b><a href="https://www.greenrecoverytracker.org/country-reports/poland">NGOs are sceptical</a></b>.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Further, the <b>European Central Bank is still providing colossal economic support</b> to the countries of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), with most central 
            banks in Member States outside the Eurozone engaged in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ecb-likely-keep-buying-bonds-through-2022-could-resume-pepp-report-2021-11-30/">similar ongoing non-standard policy measures</a>. 
            All Member States have throughout the pandemic similarly employed vast spending programmes and extended deficit expenditure to hinder job losses and wage decreases, 
            with some <a href="https://epthinktank.eu/2022/02/02/economic-and-budgetary-outlook-for-the-european-union-2022/">continuing the programmes into 2022 and 2023</a>. 
            In response to the expansion of financial relief, inflation throughout the EU has increased to levels not noted in decades – consequently, 
            <b><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22268787/larry-summers-op-ed-biden-stimulus">worries may arise as to the viability of lasting widespread monetary and fiscal stimulus</a></b> 
            as a catalyst for economic growth.
        </p>

        <h2>Ideologies and Schools of Thought </h2>

        <p>
            As is custom on most issues of major importance in the European discourse, clashes exist between those who believe further EU integration and collaboration 
            paves the way for common prosperity, and those who believe supranational interference in sovereign nation states should be minimised. <b>Schisms often materialise 
            between net contributors and net beneficiaries of EU funds</b>. Geographically, differences on financial policy tend to emerge along a Northern and Southern divide. 
            In passing the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) – the EU’s long-term budget – for 2021–2027, of which NextGenerationEU is part, debate arose as to the size of 
            the Union’s collective spending to help Member States rebuild and recover post-pandemic. While Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, and Hungary sought to <b>expand the proportion 
            of recovery funds allocated as grants</b>, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands (a group known as the “frugal four”) instead argued a 
            <b><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/charles-michel-eu-budget-fight/">majority of funding should come in the form of loans</a></b> – to be paid back by the 
            Member States which received them. NextGenerationEU spending was eventually agreed to be equally split, with <b>50% of funds assigned as grants, and 50% assigned as loans</b>. 
            Yet, with the passing of the MFF came another question: how should the EU ascertain that, as it prepared its’ largest budgetary programme ever, Union funding did not 
            become complicit in infringements on democracy, human security, and civil liberties? A protracted and controversial issue, the answer elected was the implementation of a 
            “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/protection-eu-budget/rule-law-conditionality-regulation_en">rule of law conditionality regulation</a>”. Since 2021, the EU <b>has been 
            able to withhold funding to Member States</b>, should the Union believe actions taken by any one country places <b>EU financial interests in danger</b>. Supporters of the regulation 
            contend the measure will deter governments from trying to dismantle democratic institutions, strengthen adherence to the EU’s common values and provide a 
            <a href="https://www.europeanpapers.eu/en/europeanforum/rule-law-conditionality-long-awaited-step-towards-solution-rule-law-crisis">stronger framework for meeting European and global challenges</a>. 
            Critics claim conditioning funding will only hurt already marginalised groups in poorer states, while doing little to dissuade governments from taking financially <a href="https://www.ceps.eu/rule-of-law-and-the-next-generation-eu-recovery/">erroneous decisions and engaging in anti-democratic behaviour</a>. 
            In <b>staunch opposition to the conditionality regulation stand Poland and Hungary</b>, of which the former has already <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/focus/20220216-polish-judicial-reforms-key-to-eu-rule-of-law-conditionality-row">halted planned development programmes</a> dependent on EU funding 
            in response to the European Court of Justice’s ruling in February 2022 on the issue; the Court in its decision stated that the introduction of a rule-of-law mechanism "was adopted on an appropriate legal basis".
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p>How the EU continues to engage with the great threats of our time – COVID-19, the Russo-Ukrainian war, and climate change – will play a large part in determining Europe’s role in 
            the world and the future direction of the Union. While the European Commission and Member States have largely touted the passing of NextGenerationEU as a considerable success, 
            <b>questions remain as to whether the adoption of the RRF and MFF 2021–2027 will truly be a watershed moment</b> for the EU – pointing the way towards deeper future European cooperation. 
            Still, the von der Leyen Commission has reason to be sanguine: NextGenerationEU funds have begun arriving in Member States, green energy is increasingly replacing fossil fuels in the 
            European energy mix, and the EU has shown <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-invasion-sanctions.html">unanticipated unity</a> in enacting sanctions on those 
            responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yet, hazards lie in the future. The embracement of unprecedented common debt in the EU risks placing additional stress on government finances in 
            Member States with high debt-to-GDP ratios. To tackle inflation worries, the ECB and European central banks alike have signalled <b>likely interest rate increases</b> coming in 2022 and 2023. 
            Such moves would hike interest expenditure and cause a <b><a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/fsr/focus/2021/html/ecb.fsrbox202111_01~f37aaca9fb.en.html">jump in debt financing costs</a></b> for the Member 
            States at a time when average EU national debt is at an all-time high. With the ECB expected to scale back its usage of QE by the end of 2023, a number of highly indebted Member States may subsequently 
            <b><a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/211393/2_Tamborini%20final.pdf">need to enforce strategies of fiscal consolidation</a></b> 
            and austerity programmes to avoid financial instability and a loss of investor confidence.
        </p>
        
        <p><br><b>Questions to consider:</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>With climate change predicted to escalate the chance of <b>new disease outbreaks</b>, what should the EU do to assure it is financially able to 
                support Member States in the case of a new pandemic?</li>
            <li>How should the EU work to ensure <b>financial stability</b> in the Union as the ECB ends its use of non-standard monetary policy measures? </li>
            <li>The window of discourse in European politics has shifted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic; should the EU continue seeking <b>deeper integration</b> 
                to tackle global challenges, or are Member States themselves better suited to meeting the needs of their citizens in times of crisis?</li>
                <li>Do <b>conditioning EU funding</b> on compliance with rule of law regulations and policy goals help or hinder Member States in pursuing economic development and shock resilience? </li>
        </ol>
