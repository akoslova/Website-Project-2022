        <h1>Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I (ECON I)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>What goes around, comes around:</b> The European Commission adopted the new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) in 
            2020 as a part of the European Green Deal. Bearing in mind that the transition towards a circular economy is necessary for the EU to reach its 2050 
            climate neutrality target, how can the EU move forward from a linear model of production and consumption toward a more sustainable future?</em>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        
        <p>Currently, the capitalist and western European society maintains a linear model for producing and consuming goods. Suppliers collect and process 
            raw materials from the earth, manufacturers build components to assemble into products, which are marketed and distributed by retailers, to be used 
            and eventually discarded by consumers. Consequently, value and energy are taken from but not returned to nature, but lost in waste and emissions. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Experts agree that our linear economic model is unsustainable and will have to change. In order to secure revenue in the long-term, companies need to 
            act now to change the way they do business and make a pivot to circularity. This model aims to refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, and recycle products and 
            materials in order to save natural resources. For this people need to rethink and redesign their ways of working and living. Here, (virtual) services 
            come in, closing the loops and adding extra value to consumer’s experiences. The EU can be innovative and should drive this transformation, and thus, 
            concrete policies and programs on circularity are needed. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Main challenges revolve around conflicts with both consumers and producers while political powers seem insufficiently effective in their initiatives. 
            It is crucial to understand the concepts of sustainability and innovation and how circular economy and society differ. Then, various approaches can be 
            found to address the current issues and move forward in the transition to circularity. A circular economy is more than just a move towards waste 
            reduction and increased recycling. It is a paradigm shift – a new way of thinking about economic activity - that is needed to completely reshape our 
            current economic model at a global level.
        </p>

        <h2>Keywords</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview"><b>Circular Economy</b></a> is a systems solution 
                framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. The concept is based on three principles, 
                driven by design: Eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature. It is 
                underpinned by a transition to renewable energy and materials. A circular economy decouples economic activity from the consumption of finite 
                resources. It is a resilient system that is good for business, people, and the environment. </li>
            <li><b>Sustainability</b> is an absolute term to indicate a material’s or organism’s ability to sustain itself, i.e. to keep existing. 
                <b>Sustainable development</b> is abstractly defined as <i><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/sustainable_development.html">
                development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs</a></i>. 
                The <a href="http://www.ibrc.indiana.edu/ibr/2011/spring/article2.html">Triple Bottom Line</a> is a framework to plan and evaluate sustainable 
                development in the domain of People, Planet, and Prosperity. </li>
            <li>The law of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp"><b>supply and demand</b></a> is a theory that explains the 
                interaction between the sellers of an economic good and the buyers for that good. It defines the relationship between the price of a given product 
                or service and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it. Generally, as price increases, people are willing to supply more and demand 
                less and vice versa when the price falls.</li>
            <li><a href="https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/publications/working-papers/search/result?paper=2155929"><b>Innovation</b></a> is a word used 
                to describe a vast number of changes to a firm’s activities that lead to improved firm performance. These changes can relate to new or improved 
                products or processes, investment in new machines, marketing expenditures, investment in training, the creation of intellectual property, or the 
                purchase of technology. The multifaceted nature of innovation makes a concise measure of innovation, which is appropriate to all firms, impossible. 
                Various <a href="https://www.lead-innovation.com/english-blog/types-of-innovation">types</a> and <a href="https://www.toolshero.com/innovation/innovation-matrix/">
                models</a> of innovation have been developed, like the <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/ansoff-matrix/">Ansoff matrix</a>.

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p>The European Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/economic-and-financial-affairs_en"><b>Directorate‑General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN)</b></a> is 
            responsible for EU policies promoting economic growth and recovery, higher employment, stable public finances, and financial stability. This department is 
            tasked to, among others, <a href="https://www.eumonitor.eu/9353000/1/j9vvik7m1c3gyxp/vg9hpru5j2xz">provide economic analysis and an evaluation of policy areas</a> of the European Union such as the environment. 
        </p>

        <p><br>The European Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/environment_en"><b>Directorate-General for Environment (DG ENV)</b></a> is 
            the European authority on environmental policies. This department proposes and implements policies that ensure a high level of environmental 
            protection and preserve the quality of life of EU citizens. Through shared competence between the European Commission and Member States, the DG ENV is 
            powered to legislate and adopt legally binding acts in the area of circular economy.
        </p>

        <p><br>The <a href="https://www.unep.org/"><b>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)</b></a> is the global authority and advocate on the environmental 
            agenda. It includes a knowledge platform with research publications and a Partnership for Action on Green Economy, to advise and guide countries, the 
            private sector and civil society on their paths to a green and inclusive economy. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The <a href="https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/en/european-investment-bank-0"><b>European Investment Bank</b></a> is the ‘lending arm’ of the European Union and contributes to the circular economy by providing financing, advisory support, and knowledge sharing to circular economy projects/promoters, including those with a higher risk profile.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b><a href="https://www.ceps.eu/ceps-publications/role-business-circular-economy-markets-processes-and-enabling-policies/">Companies</a></b> 
            are the driving force in the economy as suppliers, producers, and retailers of products and materials. Industries have the potential and power to 
            transition to the circular economy, but also to maintain the linear model.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b><a href="https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/cities/overview">Cities</a></b> have a high concentration of resources, capital, data, and 
            talent spread over a relatively small geographic area and are centres for innovation. By 2050 two thirds of the population will live in cities, 
            consuming 75% of the world’s natural resources, producing 50% of global waste and over 60% of greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Citizens are the receiving end in the economy as customers, consumers, and users of products and materials. Markets evolve around changing needs, 
            supply, and demand and so also have the potential and power to determine the economic model. 
        </p>

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p>
            The <a href="https://eeb.org/one-year-of-the-eus-circular-economy-action-plan/"><b>Circular Economy Action Plan</b></a> is part of the European Green 
            Deal and the ambitious follow-up to a strategy whose goals had been met. Two years after its implementation in 2020, consumer home appliances and 
            smart electronics have been redesigned for repair (although printers remain unregulated). Plans for green batteries and textile and measures against 
            greenwashing are still on the drawing board. Yet, the European Commission failed to adequately address waste prevention and recycling, particularly 
            for the built environment.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-law_en">EU laws on waste</a></b> - most prominently the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32008L0098">Waste Framework Directive</a> 
            and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A31999L0031">Landfill Directive</a> - tackle all types of waste with specified 
            directives. The 2019 Single Use Plastic Directive is a <a href="https://www.pwc.nl/en/assets/documents/pwc-the-road-to-circularity-en.pdf">recent example of 
            regulation</a> that will target, and in some cases ban, the ten single-use plastic products most often found on Europe’s beaches and in its seas.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b><a href="https://www.oecd.org/env/waste/factsheetextendedproducerresponsibility.htm">Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)</a></b> 
            is another increasingly popular approach to making the polluter pay. It makes producers responsible for the treatment and/or disposal of 
            post-consumer products (financially by paying for or physically by collecting, treating, and disposing of the products). EPR measures incentivise 
            the reduction of waste at its source. Today, many governments have EPR policies in place and the trend is towards an extension of EPR to new product 
            groups and waste streams, such as electrical appliances and electronics.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b><a href="https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/en/sector/empowering-consumers">Initiatives to empower consumers</a></b> that drive the 
            circular economy are widespread over Europe and range from DIY plastic recycling kits to webinars about greenwashing in the textile industry.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p>
            The mainstream approach to circular economy is <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dd3/f37552c105b0b13e84bafada5d04ac0c26d0.pdf">capital centric</a>, 
            i.e. focused in production on the return of financial capital. Most policy discourses and innovations are <a href="https://youtu.be/FaipZCzSvj0">meant to make capitalism more efficient</a>, 
            more lean, and more sustainable and find technological fixes around the surpluses, excesses, and contradictions of capitalist development. For the circular 
            economy to succeed a <b>design thinking approach</b> needs to be adopted, where meaningful virtual services complement or obviate physical products.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Product-as-a-service models often work better in the B2B market than in the B2C market, because <b>circular products and services suffer from a negative image</b>. 
            Consumers consider reused or refurbished products to be inferior when compared with new products. They have a misperception that circular products and 
            services are of lower quality or more expensive than traditional products and services. Incentives for consumers to repair a product instead of buying a 
            new one are <a href="https://www.ceps.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/RoleBusinessCircularEconomyTFR.pdf">generally weak</a>. 
            Although they are seeking more sustainable brands, with green considerations playing a stronger role in decision-making, <b><a href="https://www.pwc.nl/en/assets/documents/pwc-the-road-to-circularity-en.pdf">greenwashing</a></b> 
            disguises the ongoing unsustainable reality.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            In the modern world, many companies find that their business model is so interconnected with those of other companies that they are <a href="https://www.pwc.nl/en/assets/documents/pwc-the-road-to-circularity-en.pdf"><b>unable to act 
            independently</b></a> in their transformation to the circular economy. Yet, businesses suffer from a <b><a href="https://www.ceps.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/RoleBusinessCircularEconomyTFR.pdf">lack of 
            cooperation</a></b> of multiple companies along the supply chain due to their different interests and priorities. Also there is a limited transparency on the 
            origin or content of products, resources, and materials, which may discourage companies from adopting circular practices.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Measures like EPR and waste directives pressure governments and companies to limit and better process their waste. Yet, European waste processing 
            statistics are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Municipal_waste_treatment,_EU,_1995-2020_(kg_per_capita).png">misleading</a>. 
            The problem of massive piles of waste is simply moved out of sight, out of mind. <b>Waste leaks from Europe to Africa</b> through illegal routes, 
            where there's no proper facility to actually manage it. The circular potential of <a href="https://youtu.be/dUfE_eUot68">mostly e-waste is lost and human health is harmed</a>.
        </p>
   
        <h2>Ideologies and Schools of Thought </h2>

        <p> A <b>circular society</b> defines discourses with a vision of circularity where not only resources are circulated in sustainable loops, but also 
            wealth, knowledge, technology, and power is circulated and redistributed throughout society. These discourses thus comprehensively include the 
            three pillars of sustainability and see circularity as a holistic transition, where issues of political empowerment and social justice also have 
            to be addressed. In contrast, the term <b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344920302354">circular economy</a></b> focuses on circulating resources alone and deals with circularity through a technical lens of ecological and material efficiency alone.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            In social (gamma) studies, two approaches to information processing exist that can be applied to economics, but also politics and design. 
            Moving from a linear to a circular economy requires both a <a href="https://www.edie.net/library/The-circular-economy-needs-to-find-the-middle-ground/6493">top-down and a bottom-up approach</a>. 
            By <b>top-down</b>, we refer to policies that discourage linearity (such as landfill tax) and also support circularity. 
            These policies are enacted through regulatory levers only governments can control. <b>By bottom-up</b>, we mean the recognition, by companies, of the financial benefits that resource-efficient, circular, business models can bring, and to then work with the waste management sector to deliver these benefits. From a broader perspective, also users and material suppliers in the product life cycle could call for circularity.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p> The European Union (EU) has taken a particular approach to circularity, with high expectations to increase competitiveness, promote economic 
            growth, and create jobs while reducing environmental impacts and resource dependency. However, the circular economy is a contested paradigm, for 
            which many competing interpretations exist, each seeking <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352550920313750?via%3Dihub">varying degrees of social, 
            ecological, and political transformation</a>. Ultimately, political, business, and consumer powers experiment with and apply various approaches in 
            the short term to make impact on the long run. Conflicting interests and complex systems are challenging the abundance of initiatives and so thorough 
            research and constructive conversation are needed on the road to circularity.
        </p>
