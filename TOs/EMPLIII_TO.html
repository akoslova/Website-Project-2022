        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The essence of this topic is how to <b>move forward</b> to a sustainable economy and society while <b>protecting and uplifting those who are most vulnerable</b>. 
            This is particularly relevant for local communities’ rights and livelihoods. As the climate crisis develops and we move into a new phase of the COVID-19 
            pandemic, these questions have become ever more pressing. The climate crisis is now understood to be intrinsically linked to issues of <b>justice, inequality, and the rights of workers and communities</b>. 
            Policymakers must now balance local and global challenges, sector-specific issues, and competing interests in addressing these social issues and moving towards sustainability.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>Action</b> has ramped up in recent years, including through the European Commission’s Just Transition Mechanism and international dialogue at COP26 in November 2021. 
            However, much remains to be done before the <b><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/">2030 deadline for action</a></b> is 
            reached. This will involve actors on a local, national, European, and global level in order to take structural action and address these systemic issues. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            How this will be done remains to be established. Policymakers will need to consider <b>how best to move from unsustainable practices</b> in fossil fuels, 
            agriculture, transport, and other sectors while protecting and uplifting communities. They will need to take into account 
            <b>principles of a just transition and include these communities</b> in decision-making processes. Ultimately, it will be a 
            question of how to bring all of society forward together to a more sustainable and fair future. What will that future look like? 
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p><em>Global:</em></p>

        <p><br><b>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC):</b> The UNFCCC secretariat is based on the international treaty to tackle climate change (also the UNFCCC), which takes 
            inventories of carbon emissions and organises international meetings on climate change. Its goals, reports, and outcomes will all be relevant in designing accurate policy.
        </p>

        <p><br><b>International Labour Organisation (ILO):</b> The ILO’s international labour standards and its aim to “promote rights at work, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social 
            protection, and strengthen dialogue on work-related issues” will assist in adequately supporting workers. Additionally, the EU may be able to collaborate with or ask the ILO for support in this area.  
        </p>

        <p><br><b>Multinational corporations (MNCs):</b> MNCs are <a href="https://www.oecd.org/industry/ind/MNEs-in-the-global-economy-policy-note.pdf">estimated</a> to account for 26% of global employment in the 
            private sector and 20% of global emissions through their supply chains. They can hold economic influence, and policymakers will need to evaluate how best to factor these companies into the transition. 
        </p>

        <p><br><em>European:</em></p>

        <p><br><b>European Commission:</b> This is the executive branch of the European Union, this actor will be necessary to propose and enforce legislation,  implement policies and the EU budget, and set 
            priorities. The Commission has several Directorates-General (departments) which will be relevant, including the DG for Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), Climate Action (CLIMA), and Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (EMPL).
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>European Investment Bank (EIB):</b> The EIB is the lending arm of the European Union and is <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/about/index.htm">one of the largest providers of climate finance</a>. 
            This actor will be able to support policies and promote their development across the EU. 
        </p>

        <p><br><em>Local and National:</em></p> 

        <p><br>
            <b>Member States:</b> Member States will feed into the policy agenda for this topic and apply EU law within their states. The environment and economic, employment, and social policies are shared 
            competences, meaning the EU and Member States can both work on this issue.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>Local communities:</b> Local communities within and beyond the EU are seeing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate 
            crisis. The concept of a Just Transition emphasises the inclusion of these communities, and support to ensure all sectors and areas of society can move forward.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>Trade unions:</b> Trade Unions are organisations of workers coming together to achieve common goals. They may play a crucial role in 
            achieving a Just Transition for workers, and many have been campaigning on the climate crisis. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and Advocacy Groups:</b> There is a strong climate movement with Fridays for Future and other groups across the EU. 
            Many NGOs such as Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and 350.org are already working to implement projects aimed at a Just Transition. Many have been developing policy ideas which policymakers may choose to implement and policymakers ought to be aware of the public pressure for action.

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p><em>Global:</em></p>
        
        <p><br>
            <b><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-glasgow-climate-pact-key-outcomes-from-cop26">COP26 Glasgow Pact:</a></b> The Climate Pact builds on the Paris Agreement, which set a target of 
            below 2oC of warming, preferably 1.5oC. It affirms work to reduce emissions, and to phase down coal power and inefficient 
            subsidies for fossil fuels. However, it has been criticised for its lack of focus on a Just Transition. The Pact turns the 
            European Green Deal’s political commitment to EU climate neutrality by 2050 into a binding obligation for the EU. It also increases 
            the EU’s target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20211118IPR17625/cop26-meps-debate-the-glasgow-climate-pact#:~:text=It%20transforms%20the%20European%20Green,%25%2C%20compared%20to%201990%20levels.">from 40% to at least 55%</a> compared to 1990 levels. The question is now: 
            how do we meet these obligations? 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b><a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):</a></b> The 17 SDGs are an urgent call for action to move towards a sustainable world, and highlight the interconnectedness of 
            issues such as climate change, inequality, and social justice. Each Goal provides targets which could be integrated into policies to help policymakers identify clear objectives.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>ILO Guidelines on a Just Transition towards Environmentally-Sustainable Economies for All:</b> These guidelines are a policy framework and practical tool to help countries transition 
            to low-carbon economies, while <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/green-jobs/publications/WCMS_432859">maintaining worker protections and labour standards</a>. They outline guiding principles 
            for policymakers when creating policies, including fundamental rights, social dialogue and consultation, and fostering international cooperation. What should these guiding principles in policy be, and 
            how can they be integrated?
        </p>

        <p><br><em>European:</em></p>
        
        <p><br>
            <b>Just Transition Mechanism:</b> This provides targeted support to mobilise €55 billion from 2021-2027 in the most affected regions, to alleviate the socio-economic impact of the transition. 
            It focuses on three pillars: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/finance-and-green-deal/just-transition-mechanism_en">a new Just Transition fund</a>, an InvestEU Just Transition 
            scheme, and a new public sector loan facility. Policy going forward could examine how to mobilise this funding, where to spend it, how to identify priority areas, and how to integrate the three pillars. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>Coal Regions in Transition Platform:</b> This is an example of a policy to create the conditions for a just transition, it aims to support coal and carbon-intensive regions to shift to a new model and work 
            including projects in <a href="https://www.eib.org/attachments/thematic/coal_regions_in_transition_overview_2020_en.pdf">Tipperary, Ireland</a>. Future projects could examine integrating its practical approach 
            and how best to further support regions to shift to sustainability. 
        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p><b>Local vs global:</b> Many have noted the difficulty in reconciling global challenges with local perspectives and action. Policymakers will need to analyse how to ensure local communities are included and 
            protected by actions taken at an EU level, and how to ensure these take note of unique local challenges and contexts. Furthermore, different areas face the challenges of climate change and the labour market in different ways 
            and EU policies will need to take note of this. Finally, policy makers may need to assess local disillusionment with international decision-making processes and how to ensure effective participation. For example, similar 
            challenges have been seen with the COVID-19 pandemic, and how the global response has been criticised for <a href="https://www.eib.org/attachments/thematic/coal_regions_in_transition_overview_2020_en.pdf">neglecting local communities’ needs</a>, in particular local communities in the Global South.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>Social issues:</b> Action on the climate crisis and issues with the labour market is intrinsically linked with social issues such as gender, race, and economic inequality. The UN has recognised the 
            <a href="https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/climate_change/downloads/Women_and_Climate_Change_Factsheet.pdf">disproportionate impact</a> climate change has on certain communities, for example, women. <a href="https://www.actionaid.org.uk/our-work/emergencies-disasters-humanitarian-response/climate-change-and-gender#:~:text=Women%20and%20girls%20are%20more,resources%2C%20which%20are%20being%20threatened.">Women make up the majority 
            of the world’s poor, are less likely to be in positions of power, face a heightened risk of gender-based violence during and after disasters, and are more likely to be responsible for securing food and water.</a> A key challenge in this area is how best to 
            integrate these issues into policies aimed at a sustainable transition, and how to support those who are most vulnerable in society. Furthermore, policymakers will need to analyse how to include communities 
            in policymaking, and how to protect the rights of vulnerable communities. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>Competing interests:</b> The climate crisis and a just transition have many competing interests, including large companies, workers, local communities, the fossil fuel industry, and various sectors. The level of lobbying and financial power 
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59199484">differs between these communities</a>, and policymakers will need to assess how to approach this in an equitable manner. In particular, policymakers will need to assess how to ensure those who are least heard are given a seat at the decision-making table. Finally, there is the question of how to balance these interests and, ultimately, how to prioritise them in policy. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>Sector-specific challenges:</b> There are also many sector-specific challenges, which may vary between Member States. Policies will need to take these sectors into account and the specific needs they may have. The agricultural, 
            transport, and energy sectors are particularly relevant here. Action on these sectors will also have impacts on local communities and workers, and policymakers will need to address how to ensure these stakeholders are not 
            negatively impacted. For example, how to support the agricultural industry to become more sustainable and actively involve the <a href="https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/">farming community in Ireland</a>. 
        </p>

        <h2>The Past and the Future</h2>

        <p><b>Past:</b></p>

        <p><br>
            <b>1970s:</b>  The Just Transition concept emerged in the 1970s from the labour movement, responding to regulation of <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/just-transition-history-principles-and-examples-5190469">polluting industries</a>. 
            This highlighted the need to protect workers and consider labour rights when taking climate action. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>1987:</b> The Brundtland Report, “Our Common Future” was published by the UN and put forward the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/5987our-common-future.pdf">primary definition of sustainable development</a>, 
            aiming to discuss the environment and development as one single issue.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>1990s:</b> Labour organisations began to increasingly work with environmental justice groups, including advocacy for sustainable development 
            and green jobs24. Unions began to develop the concept, and it broadened to include wider change across all of society. Campaigning increased to insert the concept into 
            <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/cc/g20-climate/collapsecontents/Just-Transition-Centre-report-just-transition.pdf">UNFCCC negotiations</a>.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>2000-now:</b> The concept of a Just Transition has seen a significant increase in public and political awareness. Many international movements, for example Fridays for 
            Future, are campaigning for a Just Transition at all levels and emphasising the need for its urgent implementation.  While it was discussed at COP26 in 2021, many advocates 
            argue there is a need for more action as we enter the 2020s.
        </p>

        <p><b>Future:</b></p>

        <p>
            The IPCC has stated that 2030 is the deadline for humanity to <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/">limit global warming to 1.5oC</a>. The 2020s must be the decade of climate action and a Just Transition. Humanity is at a crossroads to 
            decide what that future will look like. Policymakers should ask themselves what they think the ideal future after a Just Transition will look like, and how we get there. It will be necessary to 
            learn from the mistakes in the last few decades, in particular of not listening to the communities who are most impacted. Instead, an intersectional and holistic approach which focuses on both the 
            long and short-term should be considered.
        </p>


        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p>As we move closer to 2030, the pressure on policymakers to achieve sustainable production continues to grow. The question of how to achieve this is complicated by the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
            and the need to ensure a Just Transition for 
            workers across all sectors of society. This will involve a variety of actors on a local, European, and global level, and will build upon previous action taken to deliver climate justice.
        </p>

            <li>What does a sustainable economy look like?</li>
            <li>Who needs to be involved in creating a sustainable society?</li>
            <li>How can we ensure the communities who are most impacted are actively included in decision-making processes?</li>
