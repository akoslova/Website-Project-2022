        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p> Europe is in the midst of a <b>housing crisis</b> with Europeans 
            spending an increasing amount of their disposable income on housing. 
            In 2021, one in ten Europeans spent roughly 40% of their income on housing. 
            Simultaneously, government spending on affordable and <b><a href="https://www.oecd-forum.org/posts/tackling-europe-s-housing-crisis">social housing has 
            significantly decreased</a></b> in most EU Member States, resulting in 
            housing inequality and widespread homelessness. In just the last decade the 
            level of homelessness in the EU increased by <a href="https://www.euromanet.eu/news/european-parliament-adopted-a-report-on-access-to-decent-and-affordable-housing-for-all-recommending-measures-to-member-states-and-european-commission/">a whopping 70%</a>, 
            not counting informal homelessness such as <a href="https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/view/597/597">“sofa surfing” and rough sleeping</a>.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>Students and young people</b> in general belong to one of the most vulnerable g
            roups which has given rise to the so-called <b>“boomerang generation”</b>. This affects 80% of young 
            people aged 18 to 24 in Europe who are unable to settle down permanently. This is caused 
            by a number of things, including <b><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/young-europeans-struggling-to-find-housing-report/">social housing shortages, inflated rent and property prices, as well as the commodification of the housing market</a></b>. 
            These problems have been further exacerbated by the ongoing Covid-19 
            pandemic as an increasing number of people are facing financial issues and the construction sector 
            has been greatly impeded. Moreover, many universities across Europe have decided to <a href="https://universitytimes.ie/2021/11/as-we-exit-the-pandemic-the-student-housing-crisis-is-a-government-priority/">limit the availability of campus accommodation</a> 
            for students to avoid overcrowding.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Housing, in particular for young people, is an increasing problem in Europe, however, <b>not all 
            countries are affected equally</b> or have the same measures in place to combat the issue. For 
            instance, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK have the biggest social renter sector, while countries such 
            as Portugal, Spain, and Greece are characterised by a <a href="https://www.stateofhousing.eu/The_State_of_Housing_in_the_EU_2021.pdf">large privately owned housing sector</a>.

        </ul>

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p>The <b>European Parliament</b> is the legislative body of the European Union (EU). Some of its key responsibilities include the supervision of EU institutions and the budget of the Union. Along with the <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/institutions-and-bodies/institutions-and-bodies-profiles/european-commission_en"><b>European Commission</b></a>
            , which initiates legislation to be approved by the European Parliament, it has the power to allocate funding to projects and initiatives that can alleviate the 
            current housing crisis in the EU as well as support its 27 Member States.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Although the European Parliament and Commission can <b>support the EU Member States</b> in combating the housing crisis, the EU holds 
            no direct competence in housing policy. Thus, it is up to each of its 27 Member States to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Aai0020">individually legislate</a>, 
            making them key players in solving  the issue. The Member States, in particular <b>cities and local governments</b>, have the possibility to 
            create policies on housing as well as fund and organise measures that can help relieve the problem, such as social housing. The EU is, 
            however, not entirely powerless in combating the European housing crisis. Through schemes such as <b><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/proximity-and-social-economy/social-economy-eu/affordable-housing-initiative_en">The Affordable Housing Initiative</a></b>, 
            which is part of the Commission's renovation wave strategy for Europe, the EU can help combat the issue.
        </p>

        <p><br><b>Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and non-profit organisations (NPOs)</b> are both important players in combating Europe’s housing crisis. 
            They can provide citizens with social and affordable housing, as well as lobby decision makers to improve financial support services and create new policies or 
            reform existing ones on the issue. NGOs such as the <b>European Students’ Union (ESU)</b> and the <b>West European Student Information Bureau (WESIB)</b> are <a href="https://universitas.no/sak/51816/shortage-of-student-accommodation-in-europe/">concerned with 
            student housing</a> in particular. </p>

        <p><br>
            <b>European citizens, in particular young people and students,</b> are the actors directly affected by the problem. A lack of affordable housing and measures 
            to combat the problem subject young people to <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/young-europeans-struggling-to-find-housing-report/">homelessness (formal and informal), debt, and prevent them from moving away from their parents</a>. 
            <b>European citizens along with large scale investors</b> (both foreign and European) are also a part of the housing shortage and rapid increase in prices of rents and 
            properties. Both actors contribute to the problem by investing in property that is then either rented out on the private housing market or through short term rental sites, effectively commodifying housing.
        </p>

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p>
            The right to adequate housing is a human right recognised in international human rights law. 
            <b><a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</a></b>, article 25 (1) states that “Everyone has 
            the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing […]”. Furthermore, the 
            <b><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a></b> includes adequate housing as one of the most 
            important rights in the EU in article 34 (3).
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The European Parliament recently passed a resolution on <b>decent and affordable housing for all</b>. In the report the European Parliament recommends a number of measures to the 
            European Commission and Member States, such as an increase in <b>European Structural Investment (ESI) Funds</b> to guarantee accessible and affordable housing, as well as the establishment of an 
            <b><a href="https://www.euromanet.eu/news/european-parliament-adopted-a-report-on-access-to-decent-and-affordable-housing-for-all-recommending-measures-to-member-states-and-european-commission/">Integrated Strategy on public, social, and affordable housing</a></b>. Moreover, a number of EU initiatives make funding available for mitigating the housing crisis. For instance, the EU cohesion 
            policy of 377 billion euros will invest in social housing, sustainable neighbourhoods, as well as other basic services.  Furthermore, the new InvestEU will <a href="https://euobserver.com/opinion/151994">support social student housing</a> 
            in the EU with 16.6 billion euros.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            However, housing and housing rights are not formally a European Union competence, and it is largely up to each Member State to implement 
            measures to combat the housing crisis. As these measures are taken on a national level, the policies implemented vary from country to country, resulting in a 
            <b>fragmented housing policy landscape</b> across the EU. During the Covid-19 pandemic, most EU countries implemented short term emergency measures to support the most 
            vulnerable households. These policies have for the most part been <b>temporary</b> and many countries fail to implement long term policies combating the European housing crisis.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p>One of the biggest challenges with the current European housing crisis is the 
            <b>commodification and financialisation</b> of the housing market in Europe, and the rising housing inequality ensuing from this. Owning property is seen as an 
            increasingly profitable asset in Europe and many people as well as large scale investors, often foreign investors such as the private equity company Blackstone, choose to invest in multiple 
            properties to either rent out on the private housing market or through short term rental sites such as <b>Airbnb</b>. This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/large-investors-drive-up-house-prices-in-europes-cities-study-finds">drives up the prices of 
            rentals on the private market</a> and forces young people and students to compete for housing with tourists. For instance, the 
            <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/young-europeans-struggling-to-find-housing-report/">average income</a> of a young person in Lisbon was 900 euros per month in 2021, while the 
            average price for a studio was 1000 euros.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            While housing prices keep increasing on the private market, Europe is experiencing a 
            <b>shortage of affordable and  social housing</b>. The investment gap in the social housing sector is estimated to be 57 billion euros 
            per year in the EU and most Member States have consistently decreased their spending on social housing in the last decade. Furthermore, students face an increasing problem with finding 
            affordable housing, fueled by the rising demand for studying abroad. In the Netherlands alone 22 000 students were unable to find student accommodation in 2020, a number that is expected to double over the 
            next few years. This forces students to look towards the private market or other alternative housing options such as hotels, which tend to be <a href="https://monitor.icef.com/2021/09/significant-student-housing-shortages-reported-in-the-netherlands/">significantly less affordable</a>.
        </p>

        <img src="Pictures/EMPLI_pic3.png" alt="EMPLI3">

        <h2>The Past and the Future </h2>

        <p>
            Many of the housing problems Europe is facing today stem from the <b>financial crisis in 2008</b>. As millions of Europeans faced evictions, investors 
            saw their chance to invest in the properties left behind, ultimately shifting housing to be regarded as a <b>commodity</b> rather than a social good. Another consequence of the 
            financial crisis in 2008 was that many countries decided to cut <b>funding for social housing</b>. For instance, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/02/dublin-booming-rich-city-housing-crisis-rent-inequality">Ireland</a> cut their spending on social housing 
            by 72 percent between 2008–2012.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Fast forward to present day Europe. Since the <b>Russian invasion on Ukraine</b> on February 24, 2022, over <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/02/27/ukraine-war-european-nations-open-their-doors-as-nearly-120-000-ukrainian-refugees-flee#vuukle-comments-1853002">500 000 Ukrainians have already fled</a> 
            the country (February 28, 2022) and as the Russian aggression is picking up pace, more are expected to come. Most refugees tend to flee to the countries neighbouring Ukraine such as Poland, 
            Moldova, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. Poland, for instance, reported that as many as 100 000 Ukrainians crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border within the first 48 hours. With the housing crisis already 
            being a pressing problem in Europe, how will Europe, in particular the countries neighbouring Ukraine, respond to the increasing number of Ukrainian refugees being forced to leave Ukraine? This question opens up a 
            broader conversation about the treatment of migrants and their right to adequate housing, especially in the context of the <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/germany/housing-migrants-and-refugees-unece-region-challenges-and-practices">recent European migrant crisis in 2015</a>.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p>The current housing crisis is undoubtedly a pressing problem in Europe, affecting young people and students in particular. 
            Some of the key challenges include the <b>lack of affordable and social housing as well as financialisation</b> of the housing market. Access to adequate housing 
            is a recognised <b>human right in international law</b>, as well as by the EU, yet the rates of housing inequality does not seem to decrease, 
            rather the opposite. 
        </p>
        
        <p><br><b>Questions to consider:</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>What can the EU and its 27 Member States do to guarantee the “boomerang generation”  adequate housing, prevent housing inequality, and informal homelessness?</li>
            <li>How can the EU and its 27 Member States incentivise local governments and NPOs to invest in <b>social and affordable housing</b>?</li>
            <li>How can the EU and its 27 Member States prevent and limit the implications of the <b>financialisation</b> of the housing market?</li>
