        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed a growing pressure on our healthcare sectors as new variants of the virus have evolved and more people are in need of extensive care. As certain countries have begun to recover and reopen after almost two years of country wide lockdown, we can now focus on improving upon our shortfalls during the pandemic. Problems in healthcare that must be solved going forward have included a lack of an adequate amount of ICU beds, an understaffing of hospital staff and a lack of capacity in hospitals for patients. With such alarming issues causing patients to lose their lives in some circumstances, it is evident that Member States must begin to analyse and improve upon current healthcare infrastructure to prepare for future pandemics.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            While many countries across the EU have begun to ease lockdown restrictions, hospitals and medical staff are still under pressure. Therefore it is clear that Member States need to focus on not only the future of Europe’s healthcare infrastructure, but also the present. Going forward, the EU will face many challenges in reinforcing its healthcare system, such as improving the EUs digital health while ensuring equitable access to all medical resources across Member States and ensuring that we are further prepared for future pandemics that may arise.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p><b>Member States and EU competencies</b> are an essential dynamic which must be considered when discussing the improvement of current healthcare 
            infrastructure. The primary responsibility for the improvement of healthcare sectors falls on the governments of Member States and the EU’s health policy has 
            been created to coexist and further improve the national healthcare sectors.
        </p>

        <p><br><b><a href="https://hadea.ec.europa.eu/about_en">The European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA)</a></b> is an EU agency in charge of managing 
            European health programmes and initiatives for the European Commission. Some programmes the agency manages include “EU4Health” and the health cluster of 
            “Horizon Europe”. This agency’s primary ambition is to help Europe in its post-COVID recovery. 
        </p>

        <p><br><b><a href="https://eithealth.eu/">he European Institute on Innovation and Technology (EIT)</a>T</b> is an agency funded by the EU to improve healthcare 
            across Member States. The EIT aims to strengthen healthcare systems and improve the financing of healthcare in Europe. They do so through the creation of 
            projects which intend to improve both healthcare infrastructure and resources. 
        </p>

        <p><br><b><a href="https://www.euhealthcoalition.eu/">he EU Health Coalition</a>T</b> is a multi-stakeholder initiative that plans the best way to use current 
            healthcare innovation to maximise the development of health sectors across Member States. They have coordinated efforts between 40 medical organisations 
            across the EU and have created a list of recommendations of ways that the EU could lead to the improvement of the healthcare sector and the sharing of healthcare data.</p>

        <p><br><b><a href="https://isqua.org/">The International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua)</a></b> is a non-profit organisation that seeks to promote 
            the improvement of healthcare across the world. The organisation has members across over 70 countries and 6 continents and they achieve their aims through 
            education and the promotion of improved healthcare infrastructure across the world.</p>

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p>
            The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health-2021-2027-vision-healthier-european-union_en"><b>EU4Health 2021-2027 programme</b></a> is an EU 
            programme that aims to improve Europe’s healthcare resistance after the pandemic. While it was created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it aims to 
            improve issues beyond the virus, such as reducing health inequality, building upon digital healthcare and reinforcing the healthcare workforce. Funding from 
            this programme is currently being allocated to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-border health threats and digital health systems.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            <a href="https://horizoneurope.ie/global-challenges-european-industrial-competitiveness/health"><b>Horizon Europe</b></a> is the EU’s key funding programme for research and innovation and has a budget of 95.5 billion. While this programme covers many areas of EU innovation, its goals for health include reducing the disease burden on healthcare sectors, fully utilising new tools for healthcare and ensuring access to high-quality healthcare for all citizens. It is one of the tools being used to fulfil the EU Health Priorities as outlined in the “EU4Health” programme and the actions are mainly being carried out by the HaDEA.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ehealth"><b>2018 Communication on Digital Health and Care</b></a> outlines the EU’s aims to 
            improve eHealth across the EU. Priorities include improving how citizens access their medical data and the utilisation of digital tools for person-centred 
            care. Person centred care is  centred around using digital tools to improve communications between patients and medical organisations as well as empowering 
            people to look after their health. So far, these measures have progressed thanks to both “EU4Health” and “Horizon Europe”.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p>Understaffing and a lack of resources in hospitals - With the COVID-19 virus running rampant across the world, the hospitals of Member States have reached their 
            maximum capacity. With a lack of ICU beds and hospital staff, Member States have seen healthcare workers forced to work <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1348-9585.12228"><b>excessive hours</b></a> 
            so that patients are receiving adequate care.  Additionally, there is an inequality in the number of ICU beds between Member States, with Germany having 
            considerably more beds per citizen than the Netherlands, for example. At times, we have seen patients being rushed to distant hospitals because those in 
            nearby proximity are at maximum capacity. With Member States <b>allocating more funding</b> to their health sectors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
            how can the EU improve current staffing and resources in hospitals? Also, should Member States further cooperate in the sharing of medical resources in the 
            case of future pandemics?
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Making digital health more accessible - With technological advancements in healthcare progressing at an unprecedented rate in recent years and medical experts 
            working together to create multiple COVID-19 vaccinations, it is clear that technology is the key to our medical future. However, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/connectivity-key-revitalising-rural-areas"><b>development of 
            infrastructure takes time</b></a> and many rural areas of Member States lack the digital infrastructure to fully take advantage of these processes. 
            Additionally, inequalities in access to healthcare and infrastructure persist both between Member States (in particular along a West vs. East divide) 
            and within their populations (rich vs. poor).  With this in mind, what can Member States do to ensure <b>more equal access to (digital) medical resources</b>
             both between and within Member States as we come out of the pandemic?
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Preparing for future pandemics - The current pandemic has had a devastating ripple effect across the world, drastically affecting virtually all aspects of our 
            lives and going forward we must strive <a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/activities/preparing-for-pandemics"><b>to improve our pandemic preparedness across the EU</b></a>. It 
            can be argued that Member States should further cooperate with each other through the sharing of medical resources to address cross-border health threats and 
            better the lives of EU citizens. With this goal in mind, we must learn from our mistakes during the COVID-19 pandemic and come up with solutions to better 
            prepare ourselves for future pandemics. Therefore, what can the EU do to <b>promote the further cooperation</b> between Member States on this issue?
        </p>

        <h2>The Past and the Future</h2>

        <p>
            Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, countries across Europe <a href="https://hospitalhealthcare.com/latest-issue-2021/hope/healthcare-in-europe-a-review-of-healthcare-data-before-covid-19/"><b>still faced a plethora of issues</b></a>
            , ranging from gradually ageing populations to an increase in the demand for technological solutions in healthcare. <b>Healthcare capacity had been decreasing</b> in many countries 
            and when paired with the overall rising population across Member States, many issues were prevalent and gradually being solved.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            With the COVID-19 pandemic placing <b><a href="https://www.covid-hcpressure.org/home/">unprecedented pressure</a></b> on our health sectors, issues such as 
            understaffing in hospitals and a lack of ICU beds have all been detrimental to EU citizens. Going forward, many states and citizens alike have learned the 
            <b>importance of a strong health sector</b> so that in the case of future pandemics, we can properly take care of patients. Considering our ageing populations 
            and the higher risk of death that old people who get COVID face, it is essential that we focus on training more hospital staff and investing more in our 
            healthcare resources.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p>
            It is evident that the COVID-19 virus has had widespread consequences across Europe and has placed severe pressure on our healthcare sector. With many 
            hospitals reaching max capacity at the start of the pandemic and patients in need of intensive care being unable to receive it due to a lack of resources, <b>
            we must ensure that an issue like this does not arise again</b>. While we are almost guaranteed to face new viruses as a society going forward, we must take 
            action now so that we don’t face this kind of pressure on our healthcare systems again.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <b>lack of technological resources and understaffing</b> in hospitals as well as the lack of pandemic preparedness across the EU for tackling pandemics has caused devastating 
            effects to citizens of Member States. 
        </p>
        
        <p><br><b>Questions to consider:</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>With all this being said, what can the EU do to further reinforce its healthcare sector as we begin to emerge from the pandemic? </li>
            <li>How can Member States further reinforce our current procedures to combat future pandemics?</li>
            <li>Additionally, how can the EU further improve our current healthcare infrastructure and solve the issues that are currently prevalent across the sector?</li>
            <li>Finally, which stakeholders should work on solutions for improving our current healthcare procedures and increasing collaboration between Member States?</li>
        </ol>
