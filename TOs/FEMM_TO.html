        <h1>Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM)</h1>

        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>#LawForShe:</b> In September 2021, Members of the European Parliament suggested making gender-based violence a crime 
            under EU law, which would allow for common legal definitions, standards and minimum criminal penalties throughout 
            the EU. With the number of women who lose their lives to domestic violence every week in the EU increasing during 
            lockdown and restrictions making the reporting process even more difficult, how can a better EU framework be 
            created across Europe to successfully combat gender-based violence? </em>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Gender-based violence has or will affect 1 in 3 women in their lifetime. This not only has devastating effects on the survivors themselves, but also 
            a wider economic impact, as the Commission estimates that it costs the EU about EUR 259 billion each year. Gender-based violence not only affects the 
            physical health of survivors but also their mental health, and can lead to self harm, isolation, depression, and suicide. Not only this, but victims 
            of sexual assault, a common form of gender-based violence, are more susceptible to developing a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and are twice as 
            likely to have an abortion.  For women, the most common reason for being homeless is domestic violence.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Gender-based violence is a difficult issue to solve as oftentimes its causes and risk factors are complex issues in their own right. Discrimination, 
            financial instability, and gender norms are all contributing factors to gender based violence. Addressing gender-based violence will require immediate 
            efforts like shelters and medical services, but also long term strategies to tackle the root causes and risk factors.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Successful steps have been taken to address this topic. The Istanbul Convention has led to improvements and increased protections in many Member 
            States for survivors of gender-based violence. The Commission’s Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025 will create a ‘gender-equal Europe’. However, 
            gender-based violence, as an issue of justice, is only a shared competence of the EU. This has led to some differences in approaches between Member 
            States: whilst some have embraced the Istanbul convention, others have refused to ratify it.
        </p>

        <h2>Keywords</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b><a href="https://www.eapn.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/EAPN-Gender-violence-and-poverty-Final-web-3696.pdf">Gender-based violence</a></b> is violence aimed at someone on the basis of their gender, be it physical, sexual or psychological, and can take the form of domestic violence, sexual harrassment, and cyber-harrassment.</li>

            <li><b><a href="https://eige.europa.eu/thesaurus/terms/1339">Rape</a></b> is ‘sexual penetration, whether vaginal, anal or oral, through the use of object or body parts, without consent, using force, coercion or by taking advantage of the vulnerability of the victim’. It is important to note that only 10 Member States define rape as including sex without consent - others require an element of force or coercion to be proven. This is a result of a failure of some Member States to ratify the Istanbul Convention.</li>
            <li><b>Ratifying</b> an international convention, as opposed to merely signing one, means that that convention becomes legally binding on that country.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p><b>The European Commission</b> is the executive arm of the EU, and is responsible for proposing and implementing European legislation. The Commission 
            has taken several measures to tackle gender-based violence in the EU, it being a key goal of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/gender-equality-strategy_en">EU Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025</a>. 
            The relevant Directorate-General to this topic is the Directorate-General on Justice and Consumers (DG-JUST). The Commission shares competence in this area 
            with the Member States, the 27 countries which make up the EU. As gender-based violence and other issues of justice are a shared competence of the EU, 
            Member States have the power to act where the EU does not, or has chosen not to act. This has resulted in Member States creating their own action plans, 
            which differ greatly in terms of content, focus, and implementation. However,  Member States must adhere to the Commission’s minimum standards, such as those 
            created for the protection of victims of violence and crime in 2011.
        </p>

        <p><br>Member States are helped by the <b><a href="https://eige.europa.eu/about/our-work">European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE)</a></b>, an 
            independent body founded by the EU to promote gender equality, raise awareness, and fight gender-based discrimination. EIGE collects, analyses, and s
            hares data on gender-based violence with European institutions and Member States, to help them to more effectively combat gender discrimination and 
            violence. Similarly, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) is the EU agency which works to instil a culture of respect for fundamental 
            rights in the EU by protecting the rights, values, and freedoms enshrined in the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. The FRA collects data on this, 
            evaluates it, and uses it to provide independent advice to the European and national governments. They work to ensure that all relevant decision makers 
            are well informed on how to protect fundamental rights.
        </p>

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p>
            The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention, is a 
            convention signed, but not ratified, by all Member States to improve the prevention, protection, and prosecution of gender-based violence. Ratifying the 
            convention has led to reforms in many Member States. For example, Malta and Croatia have changed their laws to ensure that rape is defined as sex without 
            consent, as is required by the convention, and Finland has built shelters for domestic violence survivors. However, the convention is also seen as having a 
            negative effect. Slovakia and Hungary see it as a threat to the traditional view of the family, and Turkey withdrew from the convention over fears that it 
            normalised homosexuality.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The EU does not have one unified legal measure aimed at tackling gender-based violence. Instead, there are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/gender-based-violence/ending-gender-based-violence_en">several directives and regulations</a> 
            covering this issue, in particular those relating to judicial cooperation in criminal matters, gender equality, and asylum policy. With its 
            <b>EU Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025</b>, the Commission has presented ambitious measures to prevent and combat gender based violence, support the 
            victims, and prosecute perpetrators. Additionally, the <b>Mutual Learning Programme in Gender Equality</b> has facilitated seminars on gender-based and 
            domestic violence. Due to these measures only having been taken recently, it is difficult to assess their impact.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            In February 2021 the Parliament <a href="https://www.eumonitor.eu/9353000/1/j9vvik7m1c3gyxp/vlmlkfsdb5tu?ctx=vhshnf7snxu9&start_tab1=35">passed a resolution</a> 
            calling for a directive to prevent and combat gender-based violence, highlighting the need for supports like helplines, safe accommodation, and health 
            attention for victims. The Parliament called for the classification of these services as ‘essential services’ in all Member States. In September 2021 the 
            Parliament urged the Commission to make gender-based violence a crime under EU law, a move which would allow for common legal definitions, standards, and 
            minimum penalties throughout the EU. As of yet, this has not happened.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            There are also many <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/556932/IPOL_STU(2016)556932_EN.pdf">grassroot movements and organisations</a> 
            working towards gender equality and an end to gender-based violence. These are generally newer, may be more informal, and focus more on social media. 
            These organisations also generally take a wide view of the issue, looking at how gender issues like violence can be influenced and interlinked with race, 
            disability, and sexuality. These organisations tend to receive very little national or EU funding.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p>The causes of gender based violence are themselves <b>difficult to solve</b>. Gender-based violence is caused, or at least facilitated, by numerous problems. 
            These problems are often themselves complex societal issues, which can make <a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/libraryResearch/2021/2021-11-15_l-rs-note-addressing-domestic-sexual-and-gender-based-violence-part-one-overview_en.pdf">combating gender-based violence difficult</a>. 
            For example, on an individual scale, witnessing gender-based violence as a child may normalise it for both men and women, and living with a low level of income 
            reduces a person’s ability to live independently of an abuser or seek professional help. In addition to this, oftentimes a victim’s assets are in the 
            perpetrator’s control, as is especially the case with domestic violence survivors. This can greatly reduce a survivor's ability to escape that situation.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            On a broader, societal level, the <a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/libraryResearch/2021/2021-11-15_l-rs-note-addressing-domestic-sexual-and-gender-based-violence-part-one-overview_en.pdf">lack of education on gender equality</a> 
            can prevent people from recognising and escaping harmful situations. This can be related to a lack of funding from governments on education and supports for 
            survivors of domestic abuse and other forms of gender-based violence. Social norms, like gender stereotypes, also play a key role in creating a culture of 
            accepting gender-based violence. These cultural ideologies, a patriarchal structure of society, and ideas on the natural superiority of males contribute to 
            gender-based violence, and are difficult to combat. Not only that, but other forms of discrimination can make gender-based violence worse. For example, women 
            with disabilities are much more likely to face gender-based violence than able-bodied women.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Unfortunately, when it comes to gender-based violence, it is very difficult to gather accurate data. The Commission estimates that <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/gender-based-violence/ending-gender-based-violence_en"><b>
            only a third of women</b></a> who suffer domestic abuse contact the authorities. Under-reporting happens for many reasons including the cultural 
            acceptability of violence, the level of gender equality, exposure to risk factors for violence, and a nation’s overall level of violent crime.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Additionally, complaints are not systematically recorded, and the data on gender-based violence is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/gender-based-violence/ending-gender-based-violence_en">not easily comparable between Member States</a>. 
            Myths, such as the beliefs that ‘what happens at home should stay at home’ or ‘it is nobody’s business what happens in the family’ are still held today, and 
            can be powerful forces preventing the reporting of gender-based violence. These societal pressures to not report violence means that women cannot access the 
            supports that they need, thereby exposing them to greater harm.
        </p>

        <img src="Pictures/FEMM_pic3.png" alt="FEMM3">

        <h2>The Past and the Future</h2>

        <p>
            The Council of Europe’s efforts to combat gender-based violence began in the 1990s and notably resulted in the Istanbul Convention. The Istanbul Convention 
            was adopted by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on the 7th of April 2011, and laid out a <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/istanbul-convention/historical-background">legally binding framework</a> to defend 
            women and tackle gender-based violence. Ever since the European Parliament has also been working towards gender equality, for example it has made efforts to 
            eradicate female genital mutiliation (FGM) and ensure that all Member States ratify the Istanbul Convention.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            As of February 2022, <b>not all Member States have ratified the Istanbul convention</b>. In fact, it would appear that support in some Member States for the 
            convention is slipping. Poland has expressed a wish to leave the convention, over fears that it did <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/01/istanbul-convention-poland-moves-a-step-closer-to-quitting-domestic-violence-treaty">not respect religion and promoted controversial ideologies about gender</a>. 
            This is representative of a wider East-West split in the EU over gender-based violence as a whole. For example, Eastern Europeans are most likely to think 
            that violence against women is sometimes provoked by the victim. Romanians and Hungarians are most likely to say that there may be a justification for sex 
            without consent, whilst people in Sweden and Spain are consistently amongst the least likely to say so.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            In the future the EU will not only need to deal with differing values and ideas on gender based violence, but also its forms. According to a European 
            Parliament report, <a href="https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/news/article/new-mep-report-calls-on-eu-to-take-action-against-genderbased-violence">52% of girls have experienced cyberviolence and online harassment, since the Covid-19 pandemic began</a>. 
            The EU will also need to deal with the increase in gender-based violence caused by the pandemic’s lockdowns. In France, for example, cases of gender-based 
            violence <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/opinion/its-time-for-an-eu-law-to-end-gender-based-violence/">increased by 30% during lockdowns</a>.
        </p>

        <img src="Pictures/FEMM_pic4.png" alt="FEMM4">

        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p>Gender-based violence is undoubtedly a complex issue, but as recent improvements have shown, one which can be tackled. The Commission has created its Gender 
            Equality Strategy 2020-2025 to take ambitious measures to combat gender based violence, and is also contemplating making gender-based violence a crime under 
            EU law, on par with terrorism and cybercrime. The Istanbul Convention too has led to improvements and increased protections for women. The need for tackling 
            this issue is clear: survivors of gender-based violence face the risk of self harm, isolation, depression, suicide, and homelessness as a result. Indeed, at 
            least one third of girls and women have reported experiencing gender-based violence since the age of 15, although due to the difficult nature of finding 
            accurate data on this, this number could be much higher.
        </p>
        
        <p><br><b>Questions to consider:</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Should the EU allow Member States to adapt their national strategies on combating gender-based violence  to their own cultural views on the matter?</li>
            <li>Taking into account the strength of traditional values in some Member States, how can the EU combat these stereotypes and promote gender equality?</li>
            <li>How can the EU ensure that all perpetrators of gender-based violence are brought to justice?</li>
            <li>Considering how lockdowns kept victims and abusers together with little to no access to outside supports, what can the EU do to identify and support survivors?</li>
        </ol>
