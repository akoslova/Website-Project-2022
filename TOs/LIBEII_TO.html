        <p class="topic_sentence"> <em><b>Unbreaking the news:</b> the press and media in the EU are under threat from political interference and takeovers by 
            media giants. As media freedom and pluralism are fundamental EU values, the European Commission plans to enact a 
            Media Freedom Act later in 2022. With details still being developed, how should it ensure independence and 
            resilience for the EU media market? </em>
        </p>
        <p class="chair"><br><em>By Iona Linsday (UK)</em></p>
        <div class="line"></div>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Věra Jourová, the Vice-president of the European Commission on Values and Transparency, has admitted that the "state of the media in the EU is not good". There have been multiple occasions of journalists being killed in Greece, Malta, the Netherlands, and Slovakia, and a crackdown on independent media in Poland and Hungary. Moreover, in addition to authoritarian powers, tech giants also pose a major threat to media plurality. The issue has been intensified by the Covid-19 pandemic, as whilst national media and large tech giants have the finances to adapt and seek ad-hoc solutions, smaller companies lacking funds must either choose between closure or being taken over by the larger firms, resulting in a gross concentration in news producers’ ownership.
        </p>
        
        <p><br>
            As media freedom and pluralism are part of the rights upheld by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Commission has vowed to take a strong response with its proposed Media Freedom Act to be presented in the Autumn of 2022. Hence, it is essential to ask how the Act should materialise to protect the media not just from legal and physical threats, but also the other threats it faces, including the issue of unstable revenues, monopolies, and flawed ownership structures. As stated by MEP Sabine Verheyen, ‘the whole toolbox of EU instruments should be considered for inclusion in a Media Freedom Act’. The issue itself also could not be more topical or relevant, with the Act forming a part of the Commission’s work programme for 2022. Due to the importance of the media in shaping public opinion, particularly in times of crisis, such as Covid-19 and the ongoing war in Ukraine, ensuring the safety of dissenting opinions and open discourse is essential in preserving a democratic and resilient European future.

        <h2>Keywords</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2016-44/reporterssansfrontiers_18792.pdf">Media plurality</a></b> refers to the state where there is strong variety and diversity in a state’s media systems. This refers both to diversity in opinion, voices, and analysis; diversity in types of media (TV, radio, print etc); and also the coexistence of private-owned and public media.</li>
            <li><b><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/issues/media-freedom">Media freedom</a></b> refers to the ability of journalists and reporters to freely publish information on matters of public interest. Where media freedom exists, the press is able to inform the citizens of the states of the leaders’ successes or failures without fear of retribution, and can equally act as a platform to convey the people’s wishes to government bodies.</li>
            <li><b><a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/chilling_effect">Chilling effect</a></b> refers to a situation where certain behaviour is discouraged or deterred due to a fear of a negative action being carried out against the individual as a result of that behaviour. Such negative action could consist of physical violence, economic sanctions, or just occur as a result of particularly strict legislative proposals.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p>The <b><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-commission_en">European Commission</a></b> is the EU’s executive branch, responsible for 
            drawing up proposals for new Europe-wide legislation, and implementing the decisions of the European Parliament and Council of the EU. It has 
            implemented and proposed several key pieces of legislation surrounding media freedom, including the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_85">Media Freedom Act</a>, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">Digital Services Act</a> and 
            the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2250">European Democracy Action Plan</a>. However, overall, the EU’s competence to legislate in this area is limited. 
            EU initiatives on media freedom 
            should, via the principle of subsidiarity, only act to complement relevant national rules.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            EU initiatives on media independence and enhancing transparency of media ownership should not impinge on Member States’ competence to act but should 
            complement relevant national rules.
        </p>

        <p><br><b><a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-economic-social-committee_en">European Economic and Social 
        Committee (EESC)</a></b> is an EU advisory body consisting of representatives of workers’ organisations and other interest groups. It bridges the gap 
        between the EU’s decision-making bodies and EU citizens by providing opinions to the European Commission, European Parliament, and Council of the EU. 
        In September 2021, the EESC convened to discuss the urgent steps required to protect media freedom and plurality and to ensure that all Member States 
        adopt any proposed measures.
        </p>

        <p><br><b><a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/who-we-are">Council of Europe</a></b> is an international organisation of which all 27 EU Member 
            States are part of, founded to uphold human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Europe. Within the Council, the Media and internet division 
            lead Council’s work on ensuring freedom of expression and media. The division has published several reports looking into freedom of the press in 
            Europe, whilst also organising activities, including conferences and seminars, to discuss how best to foster free speech in Europe.</p>

        <p><br>
            <b><a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/freedom-expression/-/the-council-of-europe-at-the-third-global-conference-for-media-freedom">Media Freedom Coalition</a></b> is a 
            coalition formed at the Global Conference for Media Freedom. It consists of 50 members, including many EU Member States (but notably not all), who have all 
            pledged to defend media freedom where it is threatened. Members of the Coalition have recently signed the Global Pledge on Media Freedom, promising to 
            improve domestic media freedoms and to collaborate internationally.

        <p><br>
            <b><a href="https://europeanjournalists.org/about-efj/">European Federation of Journalists (EFJ)</a></b> is the largest organisation of journalists 
            in Europe, representing over 320,000 journalists in 72 journalist’ organisations across 45 countries. It is recognised by the EU and the Council of 
            Europe as the representative voice of journalists in Europe. It supports its affiliate members to foster trade union development, in recruitment and 
            in maintaining the conditions to create quality, independent journalism.

        <p>
            <b><a href="https://rsf.org/en/our-activities">Reporters Without Borders (RSF)</a></b> is an international non-profit and non-governmental organisation which aims to safeguard the right to freedom of information and the right of the press to publish such information. It creates a world press Freedom index each year ranking the media freedom and plurality of each country, with several EU Member States including Poland and Hungary, ranking very poorly.
        </p>

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p>
            <b>The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</b> was established in the wake of World War II following the wartime atrocities. All 47 Member 
            States of the Council of Europe, including all EU Member States, have signed the convention. The convention lists a series of articles, detailing 
            human rights which must be protected. Of most relevance to media freedom is <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights-act/article-10-freedom-expression">Article 10</a> 
            which provides for the right of freedom of expression. This includes the right to express your views publicly, either verbally or through the form of media. 
            The law also protects your right to receive information from other people, for example in the form of a newspaper. However, this right is not absolute and 
            public authorities may restrict it in relation to a number of considerations including national security, to prevent crime, or to protect public morals. The 
            convention is enforced through both domestic European courts, and on appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). In applying human rights 
            nationally, signatory states are allowed some margin of appreciation to apply the rights in the unique political, social, and economic situation of their 
            country.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Furthermore, the European Commission will launch the <b><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_85">Media Freedom Act</a></b> 
            in the third quarter of 2022, aiming to better defend media pluralism and press freedom in Europe.  This Act will build upon the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/revision-avmsd">revised 
            Audiovisual Media Services Directive</a>, which regulates the independence of media regulators and promotes transparency of media ownership. 
            The new rules of the Media Freedom Act will be based on the single market, and so will focus on the private sector and attempts to defend pluralism 
            through increased transparency and scrutinising ownership. Jourová, the Commissioner behind the Act, has stated the purpose of the act is to 
            “protect the media sector against the attacks and against the efforts to capture them, to politicise them or use them for economic gains". However, 
            still at its early stage, no firm proposals have been laid down yet, merely the aims, which include breaking down internal barriers to reporting and 
            establishing a common framework advancing the internal market, in order to enhance media freedom and plurality. Jourová has however stated that she 
            expects many Member States will have various concerns with the new proposals, and so a consultation process will need to begin.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The Act is also seen to complement the EU’s other efforts in promoting democracy and media plurality, as laid out in the  Commission’s 
            <b><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2250">European Democracy Action Plan</a></b>. This plan centres around 
            3 main pillars: promoting free and fair elections; strengthening media freedom and pluralism; and countering disinformation. The Commission lays out 
            various steps it wishes to take to improve democracy in the EU by 2023, the year of the European Parliament elections.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The Act will also help the implementation of the recently adopted <b><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4632">Recommendation on the Protection, Safety and Empowerment of Journalists</a></b>. 
            The Recommendation comes after the growing physical, and digital threats to journalists within the EU and includes four categories of recommendation, 
            including general recommendations, protests and demonstrations, online safety, and digital empowerment, and women and minority group journalists. 
            Consultations will be taken with all Member States, with each Member State instructed to report to the commission how they plan to implement the 
            Recommendation 18 months after its adoption.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The <b><a href="https://www.mfrr.eu/">European Rapid Response Mechanism</a></b>, led by the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom and co-funded by the 
            EU, is another tool which can be used to boost media freedom.  It offers legal support and opinions, emergency support including offering psychological 
            support and covering travel costs, provides residencies in Germany and Italy and also provides training across Europe.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            An upcoming initiative will also aim to protect journalists from <b><a href="https://www.ecpmf.eu/slapp-the-background-of-strategic-lawsuits-against-public-participation/">Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP)</a></b>. 
            This term generally refers to well-resourced, powerful entities (e.g. a corporation or public official) launching a lawsuit against a 
            non-governmental individual or organisation who have expressed a dissenting opinion on an issue of some political or social importance. The defining 
            characteristic is usually this gross imbalance of power between the plaintiff and the defendant. Currently, no EU state has specific anti-SLAPP regulations 
            in place. One issue with doing as such as it can be difficult to determine how to protect against abusive claims, whilst not limiting access to justice for 
            those with legitimate ones. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            However, since February 2018, a group of MEPs have been calling upon the Commission to promote an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13192-EU-action-against-abusive-litigation-SLAPP-targeting-journalists-and-rights-defenders_en"><b>anti-SLAPP EU directive</b></a>
            , giving victims the ability to quickly dismiss the “vexatious lawsuits” and creating a fund supporting media groups in the midst of such lawsuits. The MEPs 
            also suggested the establishment of an EU register “naming and shaming” firms using SLAPPs. This anti-slap directive has been picked up by the Commission, 
            having finished its public consultation period with plans for its adoption in the second quarter of 2022.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p>
            Across Europe, the situation is bleak. The <a href="https://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2022/02/25/efj-appeals-for-a-strong-european-media-freedom-act/">EFJ’s Media Pluralism Monitor recorded</a> that in 2021, 
            independence is at risk in 15 out of 32 of the countries covered (with the countries being the EU member and candidate states). Despite the EU’s fundamental 
            values of freedom and human rights, as laid out in Article 2 of the Lisbon Treaty, and the EU’s membership criteria requiring states to guarantee the 
            protection of human rights, evidently various Member States are in breach of this.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            For example, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/12/eu-hungary-press-freedom/603985/">in Hungary</a>, the Central European Press 
            and Media Foundation (KESMA) was set up in 2018 and is seen as a great threat to media plurality. The foundation now controls over 500 of the country’s media 
            outlets, the vast majority of which are pro-Orbán (the Hungarian Prime Minister), publishing  stories supporting his policies and criticising his rivals 
            without factual basis. Smaller, independent journalists are struggling to survive whilst outlets supported by KESMA, are kept afloat, even where they would 
            not be financially stable otherwise. This may have a further chilling effect on media plurality. Private businesses are wary of advertising in non-KESMA 
            outlets, as they are nervous of the government retaliating.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            A report by the Council of Europe’s Safety of Journalists Platform has also found that <a href="https://rm.coe.int/final-version-annual-report-2021-en-wanted-real-action-for-media-freed/1680a2440e">Covid-19 has negatively impacted media freedom</a>. 
            Orbán  was accused of using the Covid-19 restrictions as an excuse for unjustifiably restricting journalist’s already curtailed access to government 
            information. Indeed, some European measures are said to have infringed Article 10 of the ECHR, the right to freedom of expression and information. Such 
            practices criticised by the report include the setting of fines and sanctions for reporting on the virus deemed not to be true, and also preventing the 
            media from accessing information concerning the crisis.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Furthermore, increasingly, violence against journalists has also been becoming more of an issue, with the CoE reporting it is  insufficiently deterred. 
            This is evidenced with high profile cases, such as the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Cauarana Galizia in 2017, for which only one suspect 
            <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/daphne-caruana-galizia-murder-suspect-pleads-guilty/">was sentenced in 2021</a>. 
            In Italy, France, Spain and Slovakia many journalists <a href="https://rsf.org/en/news/reporters-attacked-while-covering-covid-pass-protests-four-eu-countries">have been attacked</a> 
            by extremist and right-wing supporters during protests against the coronavirus restrictions. This may result in a chilling effect on media platforms as 
            Member States do not seem to be implementing enough protections and justice often goes unserved. In Greece and France, journalists have even been subjected 
            to police violence and arbitrary arrests during protests.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Furthermore, female journalists are often subject to disproportionately high levels of online harassment, including sexist hate speech and threats of 
            violence. These threats may amount to intersecting forms of discrimination as they are equally targeted for their race, gender identity, religion, disability, 
            or other feature of their identity. This can lead to self-censorship where targeted journalists may leave the public eye, which undermines media pluralism 
            and democracy as a whole.
        </p>

        <h2>The Past and the Future</h2>
        
        <p>With such a history of conflict, it is perhaps no surprise that Europe, despite its strive for democratic societies, has long struggled to protect media 
            freedom. The ECHR was drafted in the wake of a Europe devastated by World War II, where the fundamental rights of Europeans had been severely violated. 
            However, despite the ECHR coming into force in 1953, many European states had fallen under the Communist regime of the USSR, where freedom of expression and 
            media were severely limited. Indeed, secret police departments would punish and suppress dissenting opinions. Even with the dissolution of the Soviet Union 
            in 1991, many ex-Communist countries still struggled to change the state of media freedom within their borders. Perhaps it is this ex-Soviet influence that 
            can somewhat explain the poor state of media freedom in states such as Poland and Hungary today. 
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The future of European media freedom looks simultaneously bright and bleak. The legislative programme for the next year seems exciting, with the EU’s Media 
            Freedom Act, the Digital Services Act, and the anti-SLAPP directive all in the works. However, equally, crises tend to have a negative effect on media 
            plurality, as analysed above regarding the Coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will likely have a negative effect on media 
            plurality and freedom. The Article 10 right to freedom of expression is qualified and can be restricted in the name of national security. Hence, if conflicts 
            continue to escalate it is likely that media freedom will be curtailed in light of other, more pressing matters. President Vladimir Putin seems to already 
            be launching his attack through a filter of propaganda. The Russian government has threatened to shut independent media outlets, and the Russian media 
            have been instructed only to use official government sources for their stories and that they are forbidden from using words including “attack, invasion or 
            war” to describe the operation. Facebook and Twitter also seem to have had their access limited in Russia. As the situation continues, perhaps such a 
            crackdown will be seen across Europe.

        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p>
            Considering the unique challenges that face both Europe and individual Member States, the direction the European Commission and other key stakeholders take 
            to protect media freedoms is ever-pressing. The European Commission’s legislative agenda for 2022 presents a prime opportunity to create contemporary, 
            effective EU wide measures. However, equally, there is a role for Member States and non governmental organisations to play when defending media freedom.
