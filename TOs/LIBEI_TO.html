        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, encompassing inventions like fully automated cars, quantum computing, and AI chips, has developed 
            rapidly. It has several potential benefits, such as ameliorating individuals’ lives and tackling global issues like climate change by offering new methods of 
            waste management, energy, and public transport.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            However, AI may also lead to negative consequences by interfering with individuals’ fundamental human rights, namely privacy, prohibition of discrimination, 
            and freedom of expression. The opacity of AI-based decisions has also been speculated to lead to decreased accountability on the decision-makers’ behalf.  
            On the other hand, it is important to ensure there is no overregulation of AI, preventing innovation and AI development.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            In anticipation, the EU has since attempted to introduce harmonisation legislation to address the aforementioned issues. The European Commission introduced 
            draft legislation, namely, the Artificial Intelligence Act 2021 (AI Act), which adopts a ‘risk-based’ approach to AI. The act has received particular praise 
            with respect to this approach. It has however also received significant criticism on various fronts. Some argue that the act is not doing enough to protect 
            fundamental human rights. For example, some commentators criticise the act’s failure to deal with the ‘root’ cause of algorithmic discrimination, or the 
            likelihood of loopholes arising with regards to the act’s transparency requirements. The requirement of self-assessments for high-risk AI is also 
            controversial on the basis that anyone could arbitrarily classify AI as fitting the assessment.
        </p>

        <h2>Keywords</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0795&rid=3#:~:text=Artificial%20Intelligence%20refers%20to%20systems,or%20speak%20with%20digital%20assistants.">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a></b> involves systems that exhibit intelligent behaviour through taking somewhat autonomous actions and analysing their environment in order to achieve specific goals.</li>
            <li>AII must abide by <b>the values of the EU</b> which, as defined in the Treaty of Lisbon, include human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights. These are therefore more extensive than Human Rights provided under the ECHR.</li>
            <li>The <b><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/demystifying-the-black-box-that-is-ai/">Black box problem</a></b> occurs where AI machines are opaque and identify patterns or make particular decisions that are impossible to explain.</li>
            <li><b><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai">Harmonisation</a></b> involves EU legislation which produces EU-wide standards in a particular sector, replacing national rules. The AI act, an example of such harmonisation, takes a risk-based approach, whereby AI is assessed on the basis of how much risk it poses on someone’s health, safety, and/or fundamental rights.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Actors and Stakeholders</h2>

        <p>Scientific organisations are important in shaping AI legislation, as they provide expert insight into the developing technologies. The 
            <b><a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/en/about/history-and-mission">Panel for the Future of Science and Technology of the European Parliament (STOA)</a></b>
            , is an impartial panel which conducts independent scientific studies for the European Parliament. Its number one thematic priority for the 2019-2024 term 
            is ‘artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies’. The panel raises awareness on the potential impact of technologies, giving advice on the best 
            course of action to be taken by the European Parliament.
        </p>

        <p><br>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-commission/what-european-commission-does/law/areas-eu-action_en"><b>European Commission</b></a> 
            is the EU’s legislator, and is the one who has suggested the AI Act. The Member States are also particularly influential as they are responsible for 
            implementing legislation nationally, especially on areas of shared competences with the EU.
        </p>

        <p><br>Development in AI legislation will have great implications in the <b>business world</b>. The AI Act imposes a need for conformity assessments and heavy 
            fines for non-compliance, affecting particularly businesses producing or selling high-risk AI. </p>

        <p><br>
            The impact the development of AI has on human rights is assessed both on the European and global level. The <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/who-we-are?desktop=true"><b>Council of Europe</b></a>, 
            as the leading human rights body in Europe, has played a major role in outlining concerns and making recommendations regarding AI and potential human 
            rights violations, also publishing studies on AI and discrimination. Furthermore, the Office of the <b><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/WhoWeAre.aspx?gclid=CjwKCAiAvOeQBhBkEiwAxutUVEc00HXfoo28rz8xneWmHKu5XEHO0lLeiHKvNYG7E08HX_5QlKY6GRoCrDwQAvD_BwE">United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)</a></b> 
            is the leading UN organisation that works to promote and protect human rights established under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). T
            he organisation calls for ‘urgent action’ with respect to the risks that AI poses towards human rights, and has published a detailed report analysing how 
            AI affects people’s rights.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Finally, there are various influential <b>non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and organisations specific to AI development</b>, specialising in digital rights, 
            and providing advice and insight to the EU, particularly regarding the AI Act. Such organisations include the <a href="https://www.bdva.eu/about">Big Data Value Association</a>
            , <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/about-us/">Access Now</a>, and <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/what-we-do/">AlgorithmWatch</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Relevant Policies and Existing Measures</h2>

        <p>
            In 2018, the European Commission created a <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/plan-ai#:~:text=The%20key%20aims%20of%20the,AI%20policy%20to%20avoid%20fragmentation.&text=The%20Coordinated%20Plan%20on%20Artificial%20Intelligence%202021%20Review%20is%20the,global%20leadership%20in%20trustworthy%20AI.">Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence</a>
            , with four key policy objectives, focusing largely on AI investment.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            It subsequently published a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:01ff45fa-a375-11eb-9585-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF">Communication of Fostering a European Approach to AI</a> 
            in 2021, presenting a regulatory proposal and revising the 2018 coordination plan. The review called for Member States to reassess their national AI 
            strategies, with 19 out of 27 Member States having adopted National Strategies for AI.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The Commission also made suggestions for reform of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:1f0f10ee-a364-11eb-9585-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF">Machineries Directive</a> 
            as it did not address contemporary risks posed by emerging technology, contained safety gaps, and inadequate provisions for high risk machines.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Finally, in 2021 the Commission suggested legislation in the area, namely the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-approach-artificial-intelligence">AI Act</a>. 
            It aims to establish trustworthy AI, whilst striking a balance between functioning of markets and the public sector as well as people’s safety and 
            fundamental rights. The AI Act is a “first of a kind" and has been described as the ‘‘most ambitious attempt’’ to harmonise AI legislation.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The act will be enforced at a national level, overseen by the (suggested) newly established <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/698792/EPRS_BRI(2021)698792_EN.pdf">European AI Board</a>. 
            Fines will exist for non-compliance, and the board will be influential in assessing high risk AI, along with the European Commission’s public database.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The Act provides a very broad definition of AI, wider in scope than most current AI definitions. It adopts a risk-based approach, classifying AI into a 
            hierarchy of four tiers: minimal, limited, high and unacceptable risk.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            On a global scale, the OECD AI developed principles and a framework for classifying AI systems. Its recommendations were adopted in 2019 by OECD member 
            countries.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Challenges</h2>

        <p>Some argue that the development of AI technology has the potential to infringe on fundamental rights. Firstly, AI can interfere with an individual’s 
            right to respect for private and family life, which includes the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session48/Documents/A_HRC_48_31_AdvanceEditedVersion.docx">right to privacy</a>. 
            Biometric recognition technology, storage of personal data, and data breaches all put an individual’s right to privacy at risk. AI has the ability to make 
            inferences and predictions about human behaviour, such as political affiliations or the likelihood of a person attending a specific place of worship in a 
            given neighbourhood. This raises concerns regarding people’s autonomy and their right to establish details of their identity, the right to freedom of thought, 
            conscience, and religion, and the right to freedom of expression.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Remote Biometric Recognition could also enable the state to systematically identify and track individuals in public spaces. This would violate individuals’ 
            rights to freedom of assembly and freedom of movement.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Furthermore, the use of AI as a forecasting tool (e.g., when creating profiles on different websites) greatly 
            <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/ReportGA73.aspx">endangers the right to prohibition of discrimination</a>. 
            Faulty data input and biased data sets may lead to discriminatory decisions, such as erroneously flagging someone as a likely terrorist. Historic racial 
            biases used in data sets, such as the focus of policing ethnic minorities, creates a risk of perpetuating discrimination.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Erroneous predictions could also lead to unlawful arrests by police forces infringing on an individual’s rights to liberty, security, and freedom from 
            arbitrary arrest and detention, and in extreme cases even the right to life. The use of AI techniques in policing, such as facial emotional recognition 
            systems which are underdeveloped and faulty, may lead to obstruction of individual’s rights to a fair trial.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Finally, the opacity of AI decisions may lead to the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/demystifying-the-black-box-that-is-ai/">‘black box problem’</a>, 
            potentially allowing States to take coercive measures, and lack accountability.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            There is however an equal need to protect innovation in AI technology. The EU is already behind in AI investments, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/european-ai-needs-strategic-leadership-not-overregulation/">investing only $2 bn in AI 
            in 2020, compared to the US which invested $23.6 bn</a>. The imposition of high fines for non-compliance under the AI act, make Europe become a less 
            attractive destination for start-ups. Overregulation could create a ‘chilling-effect’ on investment, and may put the development of AI technology at risk.
        </p>

        <h2>Ideologies and Schools of Thought</h2>
        <p>
            Although the AI Act has received praise from many, due to its comprehensiveness and because it is one of the few anticipatory legislations, it has also 
            received criticism from stakeholders and academics.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The definition of AI given in the AI Act has been <a href="https://www.bdva.eu/sites/default/files/BDVA_DAIRO%20response-feedback%20AI%20Regulation_Final.pdf)">heavily criticised</a>. 
            Some argue that the definition given in the act is too broad and may encompass far more than what is subjectively understood as AI. Others argue that the 
            definition’s lack of clarity will result in legal uncertainty and some AI systems not qualifying for it, advocating for an expansion of the scope of the 
            definition.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Although the risk-based approach system is generally uncontroversial, some argue there is a need for <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/how-to-fix-eu-artificial-intelligence-act/">greater prohibitions and regulations in AI</a> 
            to ensure sufficient protection of human rights. There is also concern regarding the regulation of high-risk AI, as the risk-assessment test is left to the 
            provider in the form of a self-assessment. This may prove ineffective in practice, and any provider could arbitrarily classify most AI as fitting the test
        </p>

        <p><br>
            The AI Act is also criticised as leaving a ‘gap’ due to the lack of a mechanism for individual enforcement rights. Under the act, individuals have no right to 
            sue or file an official complaint about a service provider for <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-8800/4/4/43/htm">failing to comply with the AI Act</a>. 
            There is also a lack of proper coordination mechanism between authorities, which could prove problematic in practice, especially regarding cross-border 
            infringement.
        </p>

        <p><br>
            Some commentators are concerned with the introduction of the legislation as a whole, arguing that the compliance costs required under the AI Act would provoke 
            a chilling effect on AI investments in Europe.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Questions to Consider</h2>

        <p>In conclusion, it is clear that some high-risk AI technology has the potential to interfere with an individual's fundamental rights, imposing on their right to 
            privacy, to not be discriminated against, their freedom of expression, and liberty. The rapid development of AI therefore calls for the EU to prepare for the 
            digital age in order to mitigate the potential impact of AI, ensure that citizens are not left vulnerable, and safeguard their human rights. The EU has taken 
            proactive steps in anticipation of such risks through its coordination plan, legislation on machinery devices, and the AI Act. Nevertheless, the AI Act is 
            criticised on various bases.
        </p>
        
        <p><br><b>Questions to consider:</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Does the act need to contain more prohibitions and regulations to ensure fundamental rights are safeguarded?</li>
            <li>Is the risk-assesment test provided in the act ineffective?</li>
            <li>Is the lack of an enforcement mechanism for individuals problematic?</li>
            <li>How can the EU safeguard human rights, whilst ensuring that the AI sector continues to flourish through innovation and development without creating a chilling effect on investment?</li>
        </ol>
