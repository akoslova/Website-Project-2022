        <h2>About the EYP in a nutshell</h2>

        <p>
            The <b><a href="https://eyp.org/about-us/">European Youth Parliament</a></b> is a peer-to-peer educational programme that inspires and empowers young people from across Europe to be open-minded, 
            tolerant and active citizens. We provide participants with a forum to develop and express their opinions on a wide range of topics. By bringing young 
            people from different backgrounds together, we build intercultural understanding and friendships across borders. EYP participants and volunteers get 
            equipped with the knowledge and the skills needed to positively shape the world around them. Thousands of young people are actively involved as 
            volunteers all over Europe, making the EYP a genuinely youth-driven programme â€“ run by young people, for young people.

    <h2>Mission of EYP Ireland</h2>
    <p>
        The <b><a href="http://www.eyp.ie/about-eyp-ireland.html">European Youth Parliament (EYP) Ireland</a></b> is a non-profit, non-partisan organisation that runs a number of weekend long conferences every year for young 
        people. EYP Ireland is one of 36 national committees of the European Youth Parliament International, the European umbrella organization of our organisation.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is our mission in EYP Ireland to develop an interest in European issues in young people in Ireland. We seek to empower the youth to question the world 
        around them and come up with innovative solutions to global problems, while emphasising concepts of cooperation and respect. It is with great pleasure that 
        we invite you to join us in this mission, and let the voices of our young people be heard.

    <h2>Elements of an EYP Session</h2>

    <p>An EYP Session is split into three distinct parts and takes place over a weekend; Teambuilding, Committee Work and General Assembly. The basic idea of a 
        session is that the delegates come together in Committees, with each Committee discussing a different European related topic. Having taken part in team 
        building exercises, the delegates participate in Committee Work, producing a resolution on their topic which is then debated in General Assembly.
    </p>


    <p><b>TEAMBUILDING</b><br><br>
        This part of the session focuses on developing communication and group dynamics among the delegates in a committee. Under the direction of an experienced 
        and trained young chairperson, each committee engages in a variety of  activities together.
    </p>

    <p><b>COMMITTEE WORK</b><br><br>
        This is the main working part of the session, in which each committee concerns themselves with their assigned relevant topic. The delegates brainstorm and 
        debate their issue, eventually coming to compromises and forming a joint opinion and vision to deal with the problem put in front of them. Their solutions 
        are delivered in the form of Resolutions, a booklet outlining the issues they identified within the topic and solutions to said issues.
    </p>

    <p><b>GENERAL ASSEMBLY</b><br><br>
        This element of the session aims to simulate the workings of the European Parliament. All committees gather and following the procedures of the European 
        Parliament present their resolutions to the assembly.
