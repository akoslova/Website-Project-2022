        <h2>Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO)</h2>
        <p><b>The kids are (not) alright:</b> While young Europeans are politically engaging for ends like Fridays for Future or 
            Black Lives Matter, the minimum age to vote - a basic aspect of political participation - remains 18 in almost 
            all Member States. Considering that the European Parliament already recommended lowering the voting age in 2015, 
            how can the EU finally enhance these rights for young people?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Culture and Education (CULT)</h2>
        <p><b>Edu technology:</b> A significant disruption in the educational systems, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, expedited 
            transition to remote learning and drew attention to the role of digital technologies in education. With artificial 
            intelligence (AI) currently high on the political and research agenda, how can the EU rationally prepare its Member 
            States' educational systems for such technological development, balancing both the threats and opportunities 
            surrounding AI?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I (ECON I)</h2>
        <p><b>What goes around, comes around:</b> The European Commission adopted the new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) in 2020 
            as a part of the European Green Deal. Bearing in mind that the transition towards a circular economy is necessary 
            for the EU to reach its 2050 climate neutrality target, how can the EU move forward from a linear model of 
            production toward a more sustainable future?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs II (ECON II)</h2>
        <p><b>Are <s>you</s> WE ready for it?:</b> With the EU directly addressing the disruption of our lives and acknowledging the need for 
            better protection from global hazards through The Recovery and Resilience Facility, the largest component of 
            NextGenerationEU programme, what future steps should the EU and Member States take to increase Europe's resilience 
            and improve the coordination of response to global challenges?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I (EMPL I)</h2>
        <p><b>Home, cheap home:</b> Irish taoiseach Micheál Martin called housing the “most urgent social issue facing our country” 
            but all across Europe, from Dublin to Athens, more and more people struggle to afford the rising costs of housing, 
            especially young people. How can the EU ensure access to decent and affordable housing as a human right for all 
            Europeans?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Employment and Social Affairs II (EMPL II)</h2>
        <p><b>Can you pay my bills?</b> Based on the 2020 Resolution of the European Parliament, a long-standing discussion about 
            unpaid internships seems to still be asking questions about whether they are a necessary bridge between education 
            and employment or an opportunity for businesses to take advantage of free labour. Should the European governments 
            take further steps and act to protect the working conditions of stagiaires and interns across the continent?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL III)</h2>
        <p><b>No one left behind:</b> The Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) was established by the European Commission to ensure that 
            the transition toward a climate-neutral economy happens in a fair way. With climate change accelerating at a rapid 
            speed and the COVID-19 pandemic posing unprecedented challenges to the labour market, what steps should the EU take 
            to secure local communities' rights and livelihoods whilst economies are shifting to sustainable production?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI)</h2>
        <p><b>Moving to post-COVID health:</b> With the current pandemic, healthcare faced increased difficulties in accommodating 
            patients and delivering the care needed to citizens. Aware of the importance of a resilient health sector, how can 
            the EU further strengthen the healthcare infrastructure while ensuring a better prevention of future health 
            crises?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM)</h2>
        <p><b>#LawForShe:</b> In September 2021, Members of the European Parliament suggested making gender-based violence a crime 
            under EU law, which would allow for common legal definitions, standards and minimum criminal penalties throughout 
            the EU. With the number of women who lose their lives to domestic violence every week in the EU increasing during 
            lockdown and restrictions making the reporting process even more difficult, how can a better EU framework be 
            created across Europe to successfully combat gender-based violence?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs I (LIBE I)</h2>
        <p><b>Face not recognised:</b> While the EU’s 2021 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act aims to regulate AI technology, human 
            rights groups say that it is leaving citizens vulnerable, for example to discrimination. How can the EU become 
            ready for the digital age, while also upholding European values and fundamental rights?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs II (LIBE II)</h2>
        <p><b>Unbreaking the news:</b> the press and media in the EU are under threat from political interference and takeovers by 
            media giants. As media freedom and pluralism are fundamental EU values, the European Commission plans to enact a 
            Media Freedom Act later in 2022. With details still being developed, how should it ensure independence and 
            resilience for the EU media market?
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2>Committee on Regional Development (REGI)</h2>
        <p><b>All in this together?:</b> Regional inequalities remain a pervasive problem in European cohesion, with disparities in 
            income, wellbeing, and living standards existing both between and within Member States. As the European Regional 
            Development Fund (ERDF) focuses on building a more competitive and greener future for Europe in 2021-2027, how can 
            the EU ensure this future is enjoyed equally across the European regions?
